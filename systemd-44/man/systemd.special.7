.RS 4
A special target unit covering early boot\-up\&.
.sp
systemd automatically adds dependencies of the types Requires and After for this target unit to all SysV service units configured for runlevel 1 to 5\&.
.sp
Usually this should pull\-in all sockets, mount points, swap devices and other basic initialization necessary for the general purpose daemons\&. Most normal daemons should have dependencies of type After and Requires on this unit\&.
.RE
.PP
bluetooth\&.target
.RS 4
This target is started automatically as soon as a bluetooth controller is plugged in or becomes available at boot\&.
.RE
.PP
ctrl\-alt\-del\&.target

.RS 4
A special unit for the D\-Bus system bus socket\&. All units with
Type=dbus
automatically gain a dependency on this unit\&.

The default unit systemd starts at bootup can be overridden with the
\fIsystemd\&.unit=\fR
kernel command line option\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
nss\-user\-lookup\&.target

.SH "SPECIAL USER UNITS"
.PP
When systemd runs as a user instance, the following special units are available, which have similar definitions as their system counterparts:

In addition the following special unit is understood only when systemd runs as service instance:
.PP
exit\&.service
.RS 4
A special service unit for shutting down the user service manager\&.
.sp
Applications wanting to terminate the user service manager should start this unit\&. If systemd receives SIGTERM or SIGINT when running as user service daemon it will start this unit\&.

shutdown\&.target
which in turn should be conflicted by all units that want to be shut down on user service manager exit\&.
