NOTES
~~~~~

aserver
~~~~~~~
If we add it back in then we should create a new package libsound2-bin
for it.

libasound3
----------
We build libasound2-dev, making it appear that we are prepared to
support multiple simultaneous -dev packages in the future.  However,
libasound2-dev uses generically named directories such as
/usr/include/alsa/.  A future libasound3-dev should probably use
/usr/include/asound3/ instead.
