This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of System V Init.  Init
was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>.

This package was put together by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com> from pre-
distribution sources. Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org> integrated it into
the base system maintained it until the end of 1995. Miquel van Smoorenburg
<miquels@cistron.nl> has integrated debian support into the base package.

Since version 2.80, debian support was taken out of the upstream package
and is now only present in the Debian prepackaged version. This is so
that debian support can be more easily split up into several seperate
packages (sysvinit, sysvinit-rc, sysvinit-scripts) later on.
