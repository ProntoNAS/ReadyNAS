  * On some systems, /proc didn't get mounted because there is junk
    under the /proc mountpoint, makeing the system unuseable. Fixed
    by an extra check. Also warns the user. (closes: #134316)
  * Fix typos in README.runlevels (closes: #94745)
  * Update /etc/init.d/skeleton to comply with policy (closes: #96711,#121947)
  * On some systems "init" might show up as "ini" in "ps" output
    due to a off-by-one error in maxproclen calculation (closes: #132870)
  * Fix typo (SBM - SMB) in /etc/init.d/mountnfs.sh (closes: #139251)
  * Fix typo in debian/rules that installed prerm as preinst, and
    preinst not at all (closes: #148174)
  * Up severity to "high" since any program with write access to
    /var/run/utmp (group utmp) could trick the "shutdown" command into
    corrupting random files (note that currently there are no known
    exploits for setgroup-id-utmp programs).

sysvinit (2.84-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * modernized inittab manpage.
  * Don't shut down IDE drives on halt if RAID is active (closes: #127635)
  * Add /etc/init.d/umountnfs.sh to conffiles (closes: #122190)
  * Only mount /proc in checkroot.sh if it's not mounted yet. This
    gives earlier scripts the possibility to mount /proc and just
    leave it mounted.
  * Set maxproclen correctly on re-exec. Make sure setproctitle() leaves
    at least two zeroes at the end of the argv array.
  * Don't put IDE drives into standby mode at halt time if RAID is still
    active, since the RAID halt/reboot/poweroff codepath in the kernel
    still needs to flush the RAID metadata to disk. (closes: #127635)
  * Use 'dmesg -s 65536' when writing /var/log/dmesg (closes: #128568)
  * Mount /proc only if not mounted yet, don't unmount (closes: #118977)
  * Commented out kb line in sample inittab (closes: #130126)
  * Update /etc/rcS.d/README (closes: #130225)
  * Don't duplicate options when remounting rootfs (closes: #119381)

  * Don't use /etc/initlvl interface for telinit; only use /dev/initctl,
    and give a clear error when that fails (closes: #116829)
  * Add -i/--init command line flag to init - this tells init
    'behave as system init even if you're not PID#1'. Useful for
    testing in chroot/jail type environments.
  * Use --print-installation-architecture in postinst instead of
    --print-architecture.

sysvinit (2.83-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't disable write caching on IDE disks before unmounting file
    systems, since that flag is kept over reboot. Instead the
    halt program now has an extra -h switch that makes it send all
    IDE drives a "standby" command that as a side effect flushes
    the write-cache. That flag is used in /etc/init.d/halt

  * Only disable write caching on disks, not on all IDE devices
    such as CDROMs (closes: #115354,#115822,#117390)
  * Mount verbose, except for proc (closes: #115362,#111481)
  * Add comments about not using tty7 to default inittab (closes: #117618)
  * Install inittab.$(arch) as default inittab in the installation
    process, if it exists. Add inittab.s390 (closes: #113495)
  * Appears that the 'shutdown to fast' bug is closed by
    turning off the IDE write cache at shutdown (closes: #110804).
    Only thing is that this should probably get in the kernel
    somehow, as it's really a kernel bug.

  * shutdown.allow processing broke due to typo (closes: #111199)
  * Call closelog() after openlog()/syslog() since recent libc's
    keep the logging fd open and that is fd#0 aka stdin (closes: #111901)
  * Typo in shutdown manpage fixed (closes: #112815)
  * Don't remove .journal file during tmp cleanup (closes: #113564)

  * Don't do fsck -C if $TERM is unset or set to dumb|network|unknown.
    Also don't do fsck -C if `uname -m` = s390
  * Turn off write-caching on all IDE disks prior to unmounting
    filesystems. On some systems that poweroff on halt the system
    powers off before the IDE disk write cache is flushed. You do
    need to have hdparm installed to get this to work.

  * Now confirms to policy manual 2.4.0.0
  * Change behaviour of reboot(1) and halt(1) so that the default when
    the runlevel can't be determined is to call shutdown.
  * Updated README and skeleton
  * Depends on new dpkg for the new update-rc.d
  * Added re-exec patch from Al Viro (21 Feb 1998):
        'U' flag added to telinit. It forces init to re-exec itself
        (passing its state through exec, certainly).
        May be useful for smoother (heh) upgrades.

        did_boot made global and added to state - thanks, Miquel.
        Yet another file descriptors leak - close state pipe if
        re_exec fails.
  * Now no longer contains mdutils.sh and conflicts with older mdutils

    take some liberties so they are called with the argument "stop" even
    though the scripts are Sxx scripts .. (start scripts in runlevel 0&6
    seem non-intuitive anyway)
  * wall now supports a '-n' option to suppress [most of] the banner.
    Debian doesn't use sysvinit's wall, but apparently Redhat does.
  * Add '-F' (forcefsck) option to shutdown
  * Depends on kbd_0.95-2 (or higher) package for /etc/rcS.d stuff.
  * Close and reopen /dev/initctl on SIGUSR1 (mainly for a /dev in ram)
  * Add FSCKFIX option to /etc/default/rcS
  * Wrote rcS.5 manpage describing /etc/default/rcS
  * Fixes bugs:
    #13435: Could shutdown provide a way to force fsck?
    #14108: sysvinit: sulogin's timeout does not work anymore
    #14179: sysvinit: /etc/init.d/(halt|reboot) need to call mdstop
    #14357: sysvinit: typo errors into script shells
    #15010: shutdown is too fast
    #15405: sysvinit: changelog uncompressed
    #15751: "sulogin -t <timeout>" does not time out
    #15758: Outdated reference in README
