hdparm (9.43-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Synced from Ubuntu: (Closes: #725284)
    - reset apm options between devices
    - add script that gets run from udev when a new device is added
  * Added locking to prevent race in RAID setup.
    Thanks to Simon Elsbrock <simon@iodev.org> (Closes: #717190)

hdparm (9.43-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Set DEB_MAKE_ENVVARS differently in order to take advantage of
    cross-building support in cdbs (closes: #694843).

hdparm (9.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version

 -- Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2012 11:34:15 +0100

hdparm (9.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Allow udev rule to process large numbers of devices (closes: #675624)
  * Changed hdparm-functions to allow links instead of devices in hdparm.conf.
  * Taken from Ubuntu:
    Set spindown policy back to -B128 instead of -B127. Too many drives
    misbehave too badly with this setting, possibly leading to drive failure.
    We should revisit this once we understand why people's drives are spinning
    back *up* so frequently (closes: #684241)

hdparm (9.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #602522, #631614, #639660)
  * Added myself to uploaders
  * Added Homepage field (closes: #533190, #545005)
  * Changed linking stage to not strip binary, otherwise the debug package
    would be empty
  * Renamed XC-Package-Type to Package-Type
  * No longer install idectl, that relies on options that were removed, and
    ultrabayd, that relies on idectl (closes: #511283)
  * Install UDEV rule to /lib/udev/rules.d (closes: #563762, #622568) 
  * Bumped build dependency on debhelper for correct udev handling.
  * Install wiper.sh into its own subdirectory together with its README.txt
  * Recommend powermgmt-base
  * Thanks to Dmitry Smirnov <onlyjob@member.fsf.org>:
    + Added description to init file 
    + Updated watch file to fetch from sourceforge
    + Clean up old rules from /etc/udev in postinst
  * Taken from Ubuntu:
    + pm-utils script 95-hdparm-apm:
      - run hdparm on wakeup (closes: #468307)
      - full integration with pm-utils (closes: #510676)
      - adjust hard drive APM settings (closes: #664041)
    + /lib/hdparm/hdparm-functions:
      -  prepare to replace our init script eventually
      -  special handling for Firewire/USB (closes: #654873)
    + hdparm.init:
      - only use the 'apm' setting when we're not on battery; when we are on
        battery, apply the separate 'apm_battery' setting.
      - Don't call hdparm -f for every drive; no clear rationale was ever given
        for doing this, and doing so slows down hard drive access at boot time.
      - also don't call sync... (closes: #546813)
    * hdparm.conf.5
  * hdparm.conf: added apm_battery, removed command_line example
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes needed

hdparm (5.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Readability fixup in hdparm.init (closes: #294761) (thanks Thomas Hood
    <jdthood@aglu.demon.nl>)
  * Test for existance of device before running hdparm on it.  This doesn't
    really fix the problem of things like udev creating the device files so
    slowly, but it allows the init script to run to completion, instead of
    bailing due to set -e (closes: #249446)
  * Set up the infrastructure for a 2 stage call at boot time.  Unfortunately,
    the admin will have to do a little work themselves to configure this, but
    doing it automagically appears impossible in all situations, so I will not
    push it much further.  (closes: #250232, #290629)

hdparm (5.6-0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * New upstream release, blessed by Stephen Gran, original maintainer. This
    new version allows to set up parameters on IDE disks supported by the new
    libata kernel interface, that sees them as SCSI disks. hdparm prior to 5.6
    refuse to set up parameters on SCSI disks (closes: #266903).

hdparm (5.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

hdparm (5.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for nohdparm boot option, to disable init script
    I think this addresses the last of the problems with #247170, so I am
    going to say (closes: #247170)
  * Fix typo in hdparm.conf (closes: #248934)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 2004 14:24:45 -0400

hdparm (5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in some manpage fixups, hopefully increasing clarity.
  * The start link is run too early for people who need modules for their
    controller loaded in order to use DMA.  Added a note to README.Debian
    explaining what people can do in these circumstances, but leave the link
    alone.  It's safer for the start script to fail than to have silent data
    corruption by running it too late by default. (closes: #233188)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Mar 2004 15:16:08 -0500

hdparm (5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #232613)
  * Add warning about examples in conf file - some are for devfs, and some
    are not.  I thought this was clear enough, but I guess not.
    (closes: #231641)
  * Fix up typo in /etc/apm.d/20hdparm (closes: #231822)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Feb 2004 00:18:07 -0500

hdparm (5.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I'm actually putting the changes in this version" release.
  * Bump up version dependency on debhelper to 4.1.17 for dh_installinit's
    --no-start option.  Thanks to Thomas Hood for noticing I forgot to
    actually include this. (closes: #230496)
  * Actually include the fixed manpage this time. (closes: #230331)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jan 2004 15:55:47 -0500

hdparm (5.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for -K and -k (keep settings over reset) - thanks Shaul Karl
    <shaulk@actcom.net.il> for patches. (closes: #229022)
  * Hopefully explained -M (acoustic management feature a little more clearly
    in manpage, and added pointer to READM.acoustic (closes: #230331)
  * Work a little smarter, instead of a little harder, thanks to Thomas
    Hood.  Let dh_installinit do The Right Thing, and use --no-start option, 
    so it doesn't add the invoke-rc.d lines in postinst and prerm. 

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jan 2004 13:29:54 -0500

hdparm (5.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added note to README.Debian to warn about the use of the init script with
    MD arrays (thanks David Harris for bringing this to my attention).  Added
    pointer to README.Debian to hdparm.conf as well, reminding people to be
    aware of known issues before enabling the initscript.
  * Finally wrapped my head around invoke-rc.d a little better (thanks to all
    those on debian-devel who helped me out here).  Explicitly adding a K link
    in all run levels will prevent invoke-rc.d from rerunning the script on
    upgrade, where only having an S link in rcS.d apparently did not do the
    expected.  That should take care of that nagging detail that I thought had
    actually been fixed in -7, and really deal with all the parts of #224961.
  * Allow for setting APM functions (-B) in init script. (closes: #226124)
  * Fix bug in /etc/apm/20hdparm that made script exit without doing anything,
    since test $variable || exit 0 tested non-declared variable.

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jan 2004 13:16:26 -0500

hdparm (5.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

hdparm (5.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved /etc/default/hdparm to /etc/hdparm.conf, because this is actually
    policy compliant.  It turns out (mea culpa) default/ files need to be
    shell scripts, which this is not.  Thanks for noticing this, joeyh.
    (closes: #222133)
  * Fixed manpage typo in section -M.  Thanks, Adrian.  (closes: #222557)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Dec 2003 14:28:07 -0500

hdparm (5.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed parsing of -c to accept multiple values instead of it being a 
     boolean option (closes: #219641)
  * Make initscript parsing of /etc/default/ file more flexible - now allows
     parsing of lines that contain whitespace in addition to a newline.  Also
     now has large note at top describing currently allowed syntax.
     (closes: #219138)

 -- Stephen Gran <sgran@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 2003 23:10:01 -0500
