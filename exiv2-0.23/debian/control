  * print Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata in different formats: 
    - Exif summary info, interpreted values, or the plain data for each tag
  * set, add and delete Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata from command line
    modify commands or command scripts
  * adjust the Exif timestamp (that's how it all started...)
  * rename Exif image files according to the Exif timestamp
  * extract, insert and delete Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata and JPEG comments
  * extract previews from RAW images and thumbnails from the Exif metadata
  * insert and delete the thumbnail image embedded in the Exif metadata

 It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP
 metadata of images in various formats
 .
 Exiv2 library provides:
  * fast read and write access to the Exif, IPTC, and XMP metadata of an image
  * an easy to use and extensively documented API
  * conversions of Exif and IPTC metadata to XMP and vice versa
  * a smart IPTC implementation that does not affect data that programs like
    Photoshop store in the same image segment
  * Exif Makernote support:
    - Makernote tags can be read and written just like any other metadata
    - a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the Makernote
  * a simple interface to extract previews embedded in RAW images and Exif
    thumbnails
  * set and delete methods for Exif thumbnails
