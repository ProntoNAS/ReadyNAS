README for the debian-archive-keyring package
=============================================


Introduction
------------

The Debian project signs its Release files that are stored on the
debian ftp-server and its mirrors with the keys contained in this
packages.

A quick overview about this package:
* This keyrings are used by "apt" versions 0.6 and later. They 
  will be used with the apt-key command.
* Normally (i.e. if the apt-key binary is found), the keys contained in
  the debian-archive-keyring package will be automatically installed into
  apt's trusted keyring by the package's postinst script and keys that are 
  in the debian-archive-keyring-removed will be automatically removed.
* If the automatic installation of the keys fails, then the user can run
  "apt-key update" manually.
