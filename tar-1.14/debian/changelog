tar (1.13.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * new upstream version, released specifically to help close bugs in woody
    upstream (Paul Eggert) says:
      regarding 1.13.22
        This fixes Debian bug 92106, in addition to the bug fixes I already
        reported to you for GNU tar 1.13.20 and 1.13.21.  It also fixes a
        core-dump bug for tar 1.13.19 and later, reported to bug-tar.
      regarding 1.13.21
        This fixes Debian bug 95984, in addition to the bug fixes I already
        reported to you for 1.13.20.  It also upgrades tar to use gettext
        0.10.39.
      regarding 1.13.20
        I haven't had time to fix all or even most of the bugs, but I suggest
        closing out or modifying the following bug reports:
        13312 I changed tar to avoid the problem (I hope; I can't test it).
        52092 Fixed.
        58890 Fixed, I think -- at least, I can't reproduce it now.
        65719 Not a bug? last message in that bug report says it works for him.
        77664 Not a bug.  In that context FOO:BAR means 'file BAR on host FOO'.
        78179 Sorry, I don't follow this report.  Tar does strip leading '/'s 
        	for me.
        83458 Fixed.
        83735 Fixed.
        85400 Fixed for the info page only.  The man page is not part of 
        	tar-1.13.20.
        90794 This partly seems to be a Debian packaging problem; see 94257.
        94287 Fixed.
        95344 Fixed.
        95984 Not fixed in 1.13.20, but will be fixed in next version.
        99655 Fixed.
        100883 This bug report applies to the Debian distribution only.
        100885 Not a bug; see its last message.
        105744 Not a bug; see its last message.
    closes: #92106, #95984, #13312, #52092, #58890, #65719, #77664, #78179
