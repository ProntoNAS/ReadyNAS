<h1 id="executive_summary"><span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>SQLite works by translating SQL statements into bytecode and
then running that bytecode in a virtual machine.  This document
describes how how the bytecode engine works.

</p><p>This document describes SQLite internals.  The information provided
here is not needed for routine application development using SQLite.
This document is intended for people who want to delve more deeply into
the internal operation of SQLite.

</p><p>The bytecode engine is <u>not</u> an API of SQLite.  Details
about the bytecode engine change from one release of SQLite to the next.
Applications that use SQLite should not depend on any of the details
found in this document.



</p><h1 id="introduction"><span>2. </span>Introduction</h1>

<p>SQLite works by translating each SQL statement into bytecode and
then running that bytecode.
A <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> in SQLite is mostly just the bytecode needed to
implement the corresponding SQL.  The <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> interface
is a compiler that translates SQL into bytecode.
The <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a> interface is the virtual machine that runs the
bytecode contained within the <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a>.

</p><p>The bytecode virtual machine is the heart of SQLite.
Programmers who want to understand how SQLite operates internally
must be familiar with the bytecode engine.

</p><p>Historically, the bytecode engine in SQLite is called the
"Virtual DataBase Engine" or "VDBE".  This website uses the terms
"bytecode engine", "VDBE", "virtual machine", and "bytecode virtual
machine" interchangeably, as they all mean the same thing.

</p><p>
This article also uses the terms "bytecode program" and
"prepared statement" interchangeably, as they are mostly the same thing.

</p><h2 id="vdbe_source_code"><span>2.1. </span>VDBE Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code to the bytecode engine is in the 
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/finfo?name=src/vdbe.c">vdbe.c</a> source
file.  The <a href="opcode.html#codes">opcode definitions</a> in this document are derived
from comments in that source file. The 
source code comments are the canonical source of information
about the bytecode engine.  When in doubt, refer to the source code.</p>

<p>In addition to the primary vdbe.c source code file, there are 
other helper code files in the source tree, all of whose names
begin with "vdbe" - short for "Virtual DataBase Engine".

</p><p>Remember that the names and meanings of opcodes often change from
one release of SQLite to the next.  So if you are studying the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>
output from SQLite, you should reference the version of this document
(or the vdbe.c source code)
that corresponds to the version of SQLite that ran the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>.
Otherwise, the description of the opcodes may not be accurate.
This document is derived from SQLite
 version 3.21.0 check-in
<a href='https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=1a584e499906b'>1a584e499906b</a> dated 2017-10-24.




</p><h2 id="instruction_format"><span>2.2. </span>Instruction Format</h2>


<p>A bytecoded program in SQLite consists of one or more instructions.
Each instruction has an opcode and
five operands named P1, P2  P3, P4, and P5.  The P1, P2, and P3 
operands are 32-bit signed integers.  These operands often refer to 
registers.  For instructions that operate on b-tree cursors,
the P1 operand is usually the cursor number.
For jump instructions, P2 is usually the jump destination.
P4 may be a 32-bit signed integer, a 64-bit signed integer, a
64-bit floating point value, a string literal, a Blob literal,
a pointer to a collating sequence comparison function, or a
pointer to the implementation of an application-defined SQL
function, or various other things.  P5 is an 16-bit unsigned integer
normally used to hold flags.  Bits of the P5 flag can sometimes affect
the opcode in subtle ways.  For example, if the 
SQLITE_NULLEQ (0x0080) bit of the P5 operand
is set on the <a href="opcode.html#Eq">Eq</a> opcode, then the NULL values compare
equal to one another.  Otherwise NULL values compare different
from one another.


<p>Some opcodes use all five operands.  Some opcodes use
one or two.  Some opcodes use none of the operands.</p><p>


<p>The bytecode engine begins execution on instruction number 0.
Execution continues until a <a href="opcode.html#Halt">Halt</a> instruction is seen, or until
the program counter becomes greater than the address of
last instruction, or until there is an error.
When the bytecode engine halts, all memory
that it allocated is released and all database cursors it may
have had open are closed.  If the execution stopped due to an
error, any pending transactions are terminated and changes made
to the database are rolled back.</p>



<p>The <a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a> opcode causes the
bytecode engine to pause and the corresponding <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a>
call to return <a href="rescode.html#row">SQLITE_ROW</a>.  Before invoking
<a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a>, the bytecoded program will
have loaded the results for a single row of a query into a series
of registers.  C-language APIs such as <a href="c3ref/column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_int()</a>
or <a href="c3ref/column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_text()</a> extract the query results from those
registers.  The bytecode engine resumes with the next instruction
after the <a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a> on the next call
to <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a>.


</p><h2 id="registers"><span>2.3. </span>Registers</h2>


<p>Every bytecode program has a fixed (but potentially large) number of
registers.  A single register can hold a variety of objects:
<ul>
<li> A NULL value
<li> A signed 64-bit integer
<li> An IEEE double-precision (64-bit) floating point number
<li> An arbitrary length strings
<li> An arbitrary length BLOB
<li> A RowSet object (See the <a href="opcode.html#RowSetAdd">RowSetAdd</a>, <a href="opcode.html#RowSetRead">RowSetRead</a>, and
                      <a href="opcode.html#RowSetTest">RowSetTest</a> opcodes)
<li> A Frame object (Used by <a href="opcode.html#subprog">subprograms</a> - see <a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a>)
</ul>


<p>A register can also be "Undefined" meaning that it holds no value
at all.  Undefined is different from NULL.  Depending on compile-time
options, an attempt to read an undefined register will usually cause
a run-time error.  If the code generator (<a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a>)
ever generates a <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> that reads an Undefined register,
that is a bug in the code generator.

</p><p>
Registers are numbered beginning with 0.
Most opcodes refer to at least one register.

</p><p>The number of registers in a single prepared statement is fixed
at compile-time.  The content of all registers is cleared when
a prepared statement is <a href="c3ref/reset.html">reset</a> or
<a href="c3ref/finalize.html">finalized</a>.

</p><p>The internal Mem object stores the value for a single register.
The abstract <a href="c3ref/value.html">sqlite3_value</a> object that is exposed in the API is really
just a Mem object or register.

</p><h2 id="b_tree_cursors"><span>2.4. </span>B-Tree Cursors</h2>


<p>A prepared statement can have
zero or more open cursors.  Each cursor is identified by a
small integer, which is usually the P1 parameter to the opcode
that uses the cursor.
There can be multiple cursors open on the same index or table.
All cursors operate independently, even cursors pointing to the same
indices or tables.
The only way for the virtual machine to interact with a database
file is through a cursor.
Instructions in the virtual machine can create a new cursor 
(ex: <a href="opcode.html#OpenRead">OpenRead</a> or <a href="opcode.html#OpenWrite">OpenWrite</a>),
read data from a cursor (<a href="opcode.html#Column">Column</a>),
advance the cursor to the next entry in the table
(ex: <a href="opcode.html#Next">Next</a> or <a href="opcode.html#Prev">Prev</a>), and so forth.
All cursors are automatically
closed when the prepared statement is <a href="c3ref/reset.html">reset</a> or
<a href="c3ref/finalize.html">finalized</a>.


<a name="subprog"></a>

<h2 id="subroutines_coroutines_and_subprograms"><span>2.5. </span>Subroutines, Coroutines, and Subprograms</h2>

<p>The bytecode engine has no stack on which to store the return address
of a subroutine.  Return addresses must be stored in registers.
Hence, bytecode subroutines are not reentrant.


<p>The <a href="opcode.html#Gosub">Gosub</a> opcode stores the current program counter into
register P1 then jumps to address P2.  The <a href="opcode.html#Return">Return</a> opcode jumps
to address P1+1.  Hence, every subroutine is associated with two integers:
the address of the entry point in the subroutine and the register number
that is used to hold the return address.

<p>The <a href="opcode.html#Yield">Yield</a> opcode swaps the value of the program counter with
the integer value in register P1.  This opcode is used to implement
coroutines.  Coroutines are often used to implement subqueries from
which content is pulled on an as-needed basis.


</p><p><a href="lang_createtrigger.html">Triggers</a> need to be reentrant.


Since bytecode
subroutines are not reentrant a different mechanism must be used to
implement triggers.  Each trigger is implemented using a separate bytecode
program with its own opcodes, program counter, and register set.  The
<a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a> opcode invokes the trigger subprogram.  The <a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a> instruction
allocates and initializes a fresh register set for each invocation of the
subprogram, so subprograms can be reentrant and recursive.  The
<a href="opcode.html#Param">Param</a> opcode is used by subprograms to access content in registers
of the calling bytecode program.


</p><h2 id="self_altering_code"><span>2.6. </span>Self-Altering Code</h2>


<p>Some opcodes are self-altering.
For example, the <a href="opcode.html#Init">Init</a> opcode (which is always the first opcode
run a bytecode program) increments its P1 operand.  Subsequent
<a href="opcode.html#Once">Once</a> opcodes compare their P1 operands to the P1 value for
the <a href="opcode.html#Init">Init</a> opcode in order to determine if the one-time initialization
code that follows should be skipped.
Another example is the <a href="opcode.html#String8">String8</a> opcode which converts its P4
operand from UTF-8 into the correct database string encoding, then
converts itself into a <a href="opcode.html#String">String</a> opcode.



<h1 id="viewing_the_bytecode"><span>3. </span>Viewing The Bytecode</h1>

<p>Every SQL statement that SQLite interprets results in a program
for the virtual machine.  But if the SQL statement begins with
the keyword <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> the virtual machine will not execute the
program.  Instead, the instructions of the program will be returned,
one instruction per row,
like a query result.  This feature is useful for debugging and
for learning how the virtual machine operates.  For example:
</p>

<p>Any application can run an <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> query to get output similar to 
the above.
However, indentation to show the loop structure is not generated
by the SQLite core.  The <a href="cli.html">command-line shell</a> contains extra logic
for indenting loops.
Also, the "comment" column in the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> output
is only provided if SQLite is compiled with the
<a href="compile.html#enable_explain_comments">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_EXPLAIN_COMMENTS</a> options.

</p><p>When SQLite is compiled with the <a href="compile.html#debug">SQLITE_DEBUG</a> compile-time option,
extra <a href="pragma.html#syntax">PRAGMA</a> commands are available that are useful for debugging and
for exploring the operation of the VDBE.  For example the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace">vdbe_trace</a>
pragma can be enabled to cause a disassembly of each VDBE opcode to be
printed on standard output as the opcode is executed.  These debugging
pragmas include:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="pragma.html#pragma_parser_trace">PRAGMA parser_trace</a>
</li><li> <a href="pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_addoptrace">PRAGMA vdbe_addoptrace</a>

the same sequence of bytes, it is merely interpreted as a BLOB instead
of a string, as if it had been CAST.  In other words:</p>

this transformation, the length of string P4 is computed and stored

<a name="TableLock"></a>TableLock
<td>Obtain a lock on a particular table. This instruction is only used when
the shared-cache feature is enabled.</p>

<p>P1 is the index of the database in sqlite3.aDb[] of the database
on which the lock is acquired.  A readlock is obtained if P3==0 or
a write lock if P3==1.</p>

<p>P2 contains the root-page of the table to lock.</p>

<p>P4 contains a pointer to the name of the table being locked. This is only
used to generate an error message if the lock cannot be obtained.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" align="center">
<a name="Transaction"></a>Transaction
<td>Begin a transaction on database P1 if a transaction is not already
active.
If P2 is non-zero, then a write-transaction is started, or if a
read-transaction is already active, it is upgraded to a write-transaction.
If P2 is zero, then a read-transaction is started.</p>

<p>P1 is the index of the database file on which the transaction is
started.  Index 0 is the main database file and index 1 is the
file used for temporary tables.  Indices of 2 or more are used for
attached databases.</p>

<p>If a write-transaction is started and the Vdbe.usesStmtJournal flag is
true (this flag is set if the Vdbe may modify more than one row and may
throw an ABORT exception), a statement transaction may also be opened.
More specifically, a statement transaction is opened iff the database
connection is currently not in autocommit mode, or if there are other
active statements. A statement transaction allows the changes made by this
VDBE to be rolled back after an error without having to roll back the
entire transaction. If no error is encountered, the statement transaction
will automatically commit when the VDBE halts.</p>

<p>If P5!=0 then this opcode also checks the schema cookie against P3
and the schema generation counter against P4.
The cookie changes its value whenever the database schema changes.
This operation is used to detect when that the cookie has changed
and that the current process needs to reread the schema.  If the schema
cookie in P3 differs from the schema cookie in the database header or
if the schema generation counter in P4 differs from the current
generation counter, then an SQLITE_SCHEMA error is raised and execution
halts.  The sqlite3_step() wrapper function might then reprepare the
statement and rerun it from the beginning.</td></tr>

method of the module.  The interpretation of the P4 string is left
to the module implementation.</p>

<p>This opcode invokes the xFilter method on the virtual table specified
by P1.  The integer query plan parameter to xFilter is stored in register
P3. Register P3+1 stores the argc parameter to be passed to the
xFilter method. Registers P3+2..P3+1+argc are the argc
additional parameters which are passed to
xFilter as argv. Register P3+2 becomes argv[0] when passed to xFilter.</p>

<td>P4 is a pointer to a virtual table object, an sqlite3_vtab structure.
This opcode invokes the corresponding xUpdate method. P2 values
are contiguous memory cells starting at P3 to pass to the xUpdate
invocation. The value in register (P3+P2-1) corresponds to the
p2th element of the argv array passed to xUpdate.</p>

<p>The xUpdate method will do a DELETE or an INSERT or both.
The argv[0] element (which corresponds to memory cell P3)
is the rowid of a row to delete.  If argv[0] is NULL then no
deletion occurs.  The argv[1] element is the rowid of the new
row.  This can be NULL to have the virtual table select the new
rowid for itself.  The subsequent elements in the array are
the values of columns in the new row.</p>

<p>If P2==1 then no insert is performed.  argv[0] is the rowid of
a row to delete.</p>

<p>P1 is a boolean flag. If it is set to true and the xUpdate call
is successful, then the value returned by sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()
is set to the value of the rowid for the row just inserted.</p>
