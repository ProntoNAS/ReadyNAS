SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_18_2.html">version 3.18.2</a> is another backport of a bug fix found
in SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_19_0.html">version 3.19.0</a>, specifically the fix for
ticket <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/61fe9745">61fe9745</a>.  Changes
against <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">version 3.18.0</a> are minimal.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_18_1.html">version 3.18.1</a> is a bug-fix release against <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">version 3.18.0</a>
that fixes the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a> corruption bug described in ticket
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/fda22108">fda22108</a>.  This release was
created for users who need that bug fix but do not yet want to upgrade 
to <a href="releaselog/3_19_3.html">version 3.19.3</a>.  
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_06_08"></a><h3>2017-06-08 - Release 3.19.3</h3><blockquote>
<a href="releaselog/3_19_3.html">Version 3.19.3</a> is an emergency patch release to fix a 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/fda22108">bug</a> in 
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a> logic that can lead to database corruption.
The bug was introduced in <a href="releaselog/3_16_0.html">version 3.16.0</a> 
(2017-01-02).  Though the bug is obscure and rarely
encountered, upgrading is recommended for all users, and
especially for users who turn on <a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_05_25"></a><h3>2017-05-25 - Release 3.19.2</h3><blockquote>
Still more problems have been found in the LEFT JOIN
<a href="https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening">flattening</a> optimization
that was added in the 3.19.0 release.  This patch release fixes all known
issues with that optimization and adds new test cases.  Hopefully this
will be the last patch.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_05_24"></a><h3>2017-05-24 - Release 3.19.1</h3><blockquote>
One of the new query planner optimizations in the 3.19.0 release contained
bugs.  The 3.19.1 patch release fixes them.
<p>
Beginning with 3.19.0, subqueries and views on the right-hand side of
a LEFT JOIN operator could sometimes be
<a href="https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening">flattened</a> into the
main query.  The new optimization worked well for all of the test cases
that the developers devised, and for millions of legacy test cases, but
once 3.19.0 was released, users found some other cases where the optimization
failed.  Ticket
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/cad1ab4cb7b0fc344">cad1ab4cb7b0fc344</a> contains
examples.
<p>
These problems exist only in 3.19.0.  Users of SQLite 3.19.0 should
upgrade, but users of all prior versions of SQLite are safe.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_05_22"></a><h3>2017-05-22 - Release 3.19.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_19_0.html">version 3.19.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
The emphasis on this release is improvements to the query planner.
There are also some obscure bug fixes.  There is no reason to upgrade
unless you are having problems with a prior release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_03_30"></a><h3>2017-03-30 - Release 3.18.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">version 3.18.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
This release features an initial implementation the 
"<a href="pragma.html#pragma_optimize">PRAGMA optimize</a>" command.  This command can now be used to cause
<a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> to be run on an as-needed basis.  Applications should invoke
"PRAGMA optimize" just before closing the <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>.
The "PRAGMA optimize" statement will likely be enhanced to do other
kinds of automated database maintenance in future releases.
<p>
The <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a> version control system that is
used to manage the SQLite project has been upgraded to use SHA3-256 hashes
instead of SHA1.  Therefore, the version identifications for SQLite now
show a 64-hex-digit SHA3-256 hash rather than the 40-hex-digit SHA1 hash.
<p>
See the <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">change log</a> for other enhancements and optimizations
in this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_02_13"></a><h3>2017-02-13 - Release 3.17.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_17_0.html">version 3.17.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
Most of the changes in this release are performance optimizations.
Optimizations to the <a href="rtree.html">R-Tree extension</a> are especially noticeable.
<p>
In this release, the default size of the 
<a href="malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside buffer</a> allocated for each database connection
is increased from 64,000 to 120,000 bytes.  This provides improved
performance on many common workloads in exchange for a small increase
in memory usage.
Applications that value a small memory footprint over raw speed
can change the lookaside buffer size back to its old value (or to zero)
using the <a href="compile.html#default_lookaside">SQLITE_DEFAULT_LOOKASIDE</a> compile-time option, or the
<a href="c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiglookaside">sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_LOOKASIDE)</a>
start-time setting, or the
<a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_enable_fkey.html">sqlite3_db_config(SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE)</a>
run-time setting.

One of the performance optimizations added in 3.16.0 caused triggers
and foreign keys to malfunction for the <a href="lang_replace.html">REPLACE</a> statement on
<a href="withoutrowid.html">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables that lack secondary indexes.  This patch
release fixes the problem.  See ticket 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/30027b613b4">30027b613b4</a> for details.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_16_1.html">version 3.16.1</a> fixes a bug in the row-value logic for UPDATE
statements inside of triggers.  The bug has been there since row-values
were added by release 3.15.0, but was not discovered until just a few
minutes after the 3.16.0 release was published, and so it was not fixed
by 3.16.0.  This patch release is version 3.16.0 with the row-value bug fix.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_01_02"></a><h3>2017-01-02 - Release 3.16.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_16_0.html">version 3.16.0</a> is a regularly schedule maintenance release.</p>

<p><p>
This release includes many <a href="cpu.html#microopt">microoptimizations</a> that collectively reduce
the CPU cycle count by about 9%,
add there have been important enhancements to the <a href="cli.html">command-line shell</a>.</p>

<p><p>Support for <a href="pragma.html#pragfunc">PRAGMA functions</a> is added,
so that many pragma statements can be used as part of a larger SQL query.
This is considered an experimental feature.

will keep continue to call this interface "experimental" for a few release
cycles in case unforeseen issues arise.</p>

issues in the 3.15.0 and 3.15.1 releases.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_11_04"></a><h3>2016-11-04 - Release 3.15.1</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_1.html">version 3.15.1</a> is a bug-fix patch release that fixes some minor
issues in the 3.15.0 release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_10_14"></a><h3>2016-10-14 - Release 3.15.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_0.html">version 3.15.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
The key feature in this release is the added support for
<a href="rowvalue.html">row values</a>.  There are also other enhancements and
fixes for a number of obscure bugs.
<p>
The 3.15.0 release uses about 7% fewer CPU cycles than 3.14.2.
Most of the improvement in this release
is in the SQL parser, query planner, and
byte-code generator (the front-end) corresponding
to the <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> interface.  Overall,
version 3.15.0 uses about half as much CPU time as
version 3.8.1 (2013-10-17).  These
performance measurements are made using the "speedtest1.c"
workload on x64 compiled with gcc and -Os. Performance
improvements may vary with different platforms and
workloads.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_14_2.html">version 3.14.2</a> fixes several obscure bugs and adds 
improved support for building SQLite using the STDCALL calling
convention on 32-bit windows systems.  Upgrading from versions
3.14 and 3.14.1 is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_08_11"></a><h3>2016-08-11 - Release 3.14.1</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_14_1.html">version 3.14.1</a> adds a small patch to improve the performance
of the pcache1TruncateUnsafe() routine for cases when the only a few
pages on the end of the cache are being removed.  This causes COMMITs
to run faster when there is a very large page cache.  Upgrading from
version 3.14 is optional.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_04_18"></a><h3>2016-04-18 - Release 3.12.2</h3><blockquote>
<p>Yikes!  The 3.12.0 and 3.12.1 releases contain a backwards compatibility bug!
   Tables that declare a column with type <tt>"INTEGER" PRIMARY KEY</tt>
   (where the datatype name INTEGER is quoted) generate an incompatible
   database file.  The mistake came about because the developers have never
   thought to put a typename in quotes before, and so there was no documentation 
   of that capability nor any tests.  (There are tests now, though, of course.)
   Instances of quoting the datatype name are probably infrequent in the wild,
   so we do not expect the impact of this bug to be too severe.
   Upgrading is still strongly recommended.
<p>Fixes for three other minor issues were included in this patch release.
   The other issues would have normally been deferred until the next scheduled
   release, but since a patch release is being issued anyhow, they might as
   well be included.

   <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7f7f8026eda38">crash bug</a> that snuck
   into <a href="releaselog/3_12_0.html">version 3.12.0</a>.  Upgrading from version 3.12.0 is highly
   recommended.
<p>Another minor problem involving datatypes on <a href="lang_createview.html">view</a> columns, and
   a query planner deficiency are fixed at the same time.  These two
   issues did not justify a new release on their own, but since a release
   is being issued to deal with the crash bug, we included these other
