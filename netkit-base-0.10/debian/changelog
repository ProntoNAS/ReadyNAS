netkit-base (0.10-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add inetd.conf to package. (Closes: Bug#109001)
  * Add Russian, Swedish, German, French, Portugese/Brazillian templates
    files. (Closes: Bug#114965, Bug#83612, Bug#94170, Bug#83785, Bug#93224)
  * Don't abort if killing an extraneous inetd in preinst fails (which
    should only happen if the inetd was just killed anyway). (Closes: Bug#80994)
  * Fix URL to CERT advisory on built in services. (Closes: Bug#87264)

netkit-base (0.10-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dh_suidregister, etc. (Closes: Bug#83022, Bug#84827)
  * Remove netkit-rpc, which is now in libc6

  * Include both sys/time.h and time.h so we can build. (Closes: Bug#96807) 
    We should probably switch from times()/CLK_TCK to clock()/CLOCKS_PER_SEC
    or something. Fun fun fun.

  * Fix ping on alpha. How? We don't try stuffing a timeval in the
    transmitted packet; instead we do what the comments claim we
    do (roughly): we convert the timeval struct into two four byte
    network-byte-order-ulongs, and transmit them. This should avoid any
    portability problems, on arches that require longs to be something
    other than 8 byte aligned, eg.  (Closes: Bug#69333, Bug#70595,
    Bug#72307, Bug#95017, Bug#82733, Bug#86884)

netkit-base (0.10-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed unterminated buffer bug (strncpy is used, but the resultant
    string may not be NUL terminated, and it's later printf'ed) in ping.
    Probably not exploitable.

netkit-base (0.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the --exec arguments from inetd's init.d script, so that it can
    be stopped/restarted in the postinst, after the running binary has
    been updated. Kill any additional leftover inetd processes left
    from previous, buggy, netbases in case the admin hasn't already done
    so. (Closes: Bug#69397)

  * Mark cron.daily/netkit-inetd as a conffile.

netkit-base (0.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed superfluous build-time dependency on debconf-utils. No idea
    at all why that was there.

  * debian/templates: Added Italian translation, thanks to Eugenia
    Franzoni, from netbase bug report 64219.

netkit-base (0.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * When replacing netbase, inetd gets started, but didn't get stopped. It
    gets stopped now. (Closes: Bug#68855, Bug#69030).
  * With the previous version's postinst fix, I should be able to also say:
    (Closes: Bug#68898, Bug#68871)
  * Change reference to /etc/init.d/netbase to /etc/init.d/inetd in
    inetd.8. Thanks to Alex Romosan for spotting this. (Closes: Bug#68850)

netkit-base (0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed netkit-inetd postinst to refer to the netkit-inetd debconf
    question, not the old netbase one which no longer exists.
  * Revised history (s/Initial Release/Split from netbase/).

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Aug 2000 13:06:08 +1000

netkit-base (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split from netbase.
