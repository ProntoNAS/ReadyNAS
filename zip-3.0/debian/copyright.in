This is the Debian prepackaged version of "zip", Info-Zip's fast, portable,
zipfile compression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/zip30.tgz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.
