* noflushd 2.8 (25. July 2010)

  - Add support for SGIO interface in current Linux kernels.
  - Avoid spurious spinups from udev-trigger re-read of partition data on
    block devices.

* noflushd 2.7.5 (09. May 2005)

  - Fix handling of raid and similar meta devices on 2.6 kernels.

* noflushd 2.7.4 (08. Aug 2004)

  - Fix lousy spindown times on 2.6 kernels.
  - Fix SCSI support on 2.6 kernels.
  - Fix pid detection in generic startup script.
  - Document quirks with hotplugged drives.

* noflushd 2.7.3 (09. Apr 2004)

  - Fix race condition that might leave kupdated/pdflushd disabled
    aftern noflushd has terminated.
  - Fix spindown when all disks are auto-detected.

* noflushd 2.7.2 (16. Mar 2004)

  - A change in 2.7.1 erroneously flushed the buffer cache before
    spindown, causing frequent spinups. This change has been reverted.
    
* noflushd 2.7.1 (07. Mar 2004)

  - Fix immediate spinup on 2.6 kernels.
  - Elevate SCSI support from compile-time to command line option.
  - Bug fixes in the disk statistics parser for 2.6 kernels.
  - Ship kernel patch to track down which processes cause spinups.

* noflushd 2.7 (20. Jan 2004)

  - Support Linux kernel 2.6.x.
  - Default to monitorring all disks unless specific disks are given
    on the command line. This change should yield a sane default
    behaviour for a majority of users without requiring explicit
    configuration.

* noflushd 2.6.3 (13. May 2002)

  - Bugfix for arm and other archs with weird /proc/partitions layout.

* noflushd 2.6.2 (20. Apr 2002)

  - Add IDE raid support.
  - Add timeout logging script.

* noflushd 2.6.1 (03. Feb. 2002)

  - Fix BUG when using noflushd with disks on second IDE channel on 2.4
    kernels.

* noflushd 2.6 (22. Jan 2002)

  - Document noflushd's suckage with any journaling fs, including ext3.
  - New feature prevents spindown if machine is in interactive use.
  - Add hack fix some '0 spindown time' uglies.

* noflushd 2.5 (06. Aug 2001)

  - Make sure hotplugged disks get synced properly.
  - Only sync present partitions. (Fixes high CPU usage bug on devfs
    systems.)
  - Generic startup skript works on latest 2.4 kernels.

* noflushd 2.4 (13. Mar 2001)

  - Timeout lists are back to a working state.
  - Support very latest 2.4 kernels.

* noflushd 2.3 (12. Jan 2001)

  - Support latest 2.4 kernels. (Leaves kernels 2.3.99pre8 to 2.4.0-test8
    unsupported.)
  - Fix multi-disk support with long bdflush timeouts.

* noflushd 2.2 (22. Dec 2000)

  - Fixed bug in spindown code. Now actually spins down. Duh!

* noflushd 2.1 (20. Dec 2000)

  - Disks get synced prior to spindown.
  - Improved devfs support.

* noflushd 2.0 (14. Nov 2000)

  - noflushd now comes with its own syncer that takes over the task from
    kupdate when the first read-write mounted disk is spun down. This
    enhances spindown times in a multidisk environment at the expense of
    less smooth and more bursty background flushing when the noflushd 
    syncer is in use.

  - Conflicting entries in 2.2-style /proc/stat (e.g. /dev/sda and /dev/hda)
    won't cause noflushd to give up anymore. Instead, noflushd will treat
    both disks pretty much like one, i.e. they're either both up or spun
    down, no matter if activity only goes to one of them.

  - Compilation environment switched to automake/autoconf.

  - When installing via 'make install', noflushd is no longer added to
    any runlevel. 

  - noflushd moved to SourceForge. The project homepage is located at
    http://noflushd.sourceforge.net, a mailing list is available via
    noflushd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. Visit the homepage for
