  * one more tweak to the udev detection
  * put $tty back to 0666, use it for /dev/tty (instead of $public which is

    we just hadn't done anything in postinst to force them tighter on upgrade,
    ergo the confusion in -67 and -68.  [large sigh]
  * MAKEDEV creates /dev/tty[0-9]* as 0600, and mesg wiggles the group write
