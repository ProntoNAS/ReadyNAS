  * [f70b2c6]: Handle errors in three way merges This fix is one that
    was first implemented in Ubuntu, and has only been lightly modified.
    The problem was the handling of merge failures in three way merges,
    ucf used to just pass the error through to the maintainer script,
    and so a merge failure resulted in a maintainer script failure,
    which could cascade in a upgrade. However, trapping the error, and
    showing it via debconf, and then returning to the ucf debconf menu
    allows users to resolve this issue as they please. This patch
    implements that. 
    Bug fix: "three-way-merge errors cause upgrade pains", thanks to Steve
    Langasek                                               (Closes: #543593).

  * [6e5ba1b]: Save and restore command line arguments after parsing
    This way, when the script is called again under debconf, the command
    line arguments are still around, and have not been eliminated during
    parsing. And no, getopt was not to blame, ucf was nuking the

  * [bd1dfcb]: Substitute the ucf/show_diff DIFF variable contents to

    not enough (or even needed): the sensitive data is not stored in the
    value of ucf/show_diff, but in the DIFF variable associated with it.
    Bug fix: "ucf stores diff (of private files) in debconf (world readable)"
    Closes: Bug#511893 Author: Niko Tyni <ntyni@debian.org>
  * [f5cbbdf]: Show the differences on the first try
    Until 3.0012, ucf/show_diff was reset just before showing it to the
    user. This would unset the 'seen' flag properly. However, moving the
    db_reset call after db_input made the latter skip the note on the
    first time if the 'seen' flag was already set. To make things worse,
    Debconf::ConfModule::finish() sets the 'seen' flag for all the
    questions it has handled before exiting, so the flag was always true
    after debconf exited. Simply unsetting the flag before db_input fixes
    this.

  * [29fbb69]: reset diff question after use so contents are not written to disk
    Debconf does not use world readable "temporary internal
    files" as Manoj hypothesises. Data is only written to disk if it is
    left in the debconf database when the frontend (ucf) exits.
    Tightening the permissions on the debconf database would break
    several things including use of debconf-show in reportbug.

  * [9eb5118]: ucf uses debconf even if called without --debconf-ok and hangs
    ucf, even if is called without --debconf-ok, uses debconf and
    hangs if db_stop had been already called, since it tries to load
    /usr/share/debconf/confmodule and loads the ucf debconf templates.
    This is a minimal change, and just moves the test of DEBCONF_OK
    earlier.  Thanks to  Robert Luberda for the report and suggested fix.

ucf (3.0011) unstable; urgency=low

  * [debiandir:8949365] Fix VCS-Browser URL
  * [debiandir:ede9c73] Do not depend on cdebconf as an alternative
    ucf relies heavily on debconf to do its job, and thus depends on it. Way
    back when, it was told to me that we arte going to move to cdebconf,
    which at some point will be the preferred way. In the meantime, to
    facilitate the future transition, we should all depend on
       debconf | cdebconf
    to make life in the future easier.
    
    Now, as of version 3.005, ucf started using a feaure that has long been a
    part of cdebconf, but was only ported to debconf in version 1.5.19, so
    now ucf started depending on:
      debconf (>= 1.5.19) | cdebconf
    and this is where trouble beings.
    
    Suppose a machine running stable has cdebconf installed. It also has an
    old version of debconf installed, say, one that is older than
    1.5.19. Since cdebconf was installed, the dependency requirements are
    fully satisfied, so debconf was not updated.
    
    Now, ucf follows the instructions in debconf-devel(7) -- and that just
    uses debconf, the older version which does nothave support for the
    feature ucf needs. Boom, there goes the update.
  
    This is a grave bug.

  * There was an issue that using the sdiff or diff options of ucf would
    either error out, or would hang due to a communication snafu with
    debconf. This fix handles exceptional sizes of diff output, correcting
    both issues. This is an important bug fix meant for Lenny.

ucf (3.001) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "ucf: [INTL:ru] Russian debconf template translation", thanks

  * Bug fix: "ucf: should use debconf to display the diff results", thanks
    to Gustavo Noronha Silva. Users using a Graphical frontend are
    surprised when the display apparently just blocks when they ask to see
    a diff (or 3-way diff) of the configuration file being handled, when
    actually the diff is  displayed on the terminal window ucf was run
    on. Until the debconf-escape utility and the escape CAPB support,
    db_subst ran into newline and line length issues. Patch from Michael
    Vogt.                                                 (Closes: #325576). 
  * From Michael Vogt's patch: use a debconf note for the diff. updated
    dependency of debconf to 1.4.72 (this is the version that supports the
    "escape" capability) 
  * Left in the debconf-2.0 as is, since I am assuming anything that
    provides debconf-2.0 should be a drop in replacement, or that should
    be considered a bug. This is a change from Michael Vogt's patch.

    manual page now has a reference to ucfr and ucfq. I d not think,
    however, that this merits a NEWS file: the vast majority of users who
    install ucf do so since it is pulled in as a dependency, and they
    don't care a white about ucfr being added.  The only people who might
    care are people who use ucf to manage configuration files, and that is
    a very small number.  NEWS items should be relegated to important
    information that may affect the majority of installations; and this
    does not fit the bill.

  * Bug fix: "ucf: diff is not displayed with DEBIAN_FRONTEND=dialog and

    /etc/alternatives/pager, and, failing that, ensuring /bin/more exists
    -- and then, if the pager is more, it pauses after displaying the
    diff, so that the diff is not whisked away by debconf looping back to

  Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  * Added debconf support to ucf. It will use debconf for prompting.
  * Since some badly behaved maintainer scripts use debconf, then cripple it
    (by calling STOP, redirecting stdio, etc), and then call ucf, ucf must
    take care to not use debconf if called from such a script. In this case it
    will fall back to prompting without using debconf, unless a --debconf-ok
    parameter is given, to let ucf know that the maintainer script
    promises it has not screwed up debconf.
  * Update ucf.1
  * Since the above hack means that ucf retains the ability to prompt
    on its own, I made it not depend on debconf at all; if debconf is not
    present then ucf will fall back to its internal prompter. closes: Bug#234151
