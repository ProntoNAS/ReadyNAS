New Features

9.7.2

     * Zones may be dynamically added and removed with the "rndc addzone"
       and "rndc delzone" commands. These dynamically added zones are
       written to a per-view configuration file. Do not rely on the
       configuration file name nor contents as this will change in a
       future release. This is an experimental feature at this time.
     * Added new "filter-aaaa-on-v4" access control list to select which
       IPv4 clients have AAAA record filtering applied.
     * A new command "rndc secroots" was added to dump a combined summary
       of the currently managed keys combined with statically configured
       trust anchors.
     * Added support to load new keys into managed zones without signing
       immediately with "rndc loadkeys". Added support to link keys with
       "dnssec-keygen -S" and "dnssec-settime -S".

Feature Changes

9.7.2

     * Documentation improvements
     * ORCHID prefixes were removed from the automatic empty zone list.
     * Improved handling of GSSAPI security contexts. Specifically, better
       memory management of cached contexts, limited lifetime of a context
       to 1 hour, and added a "realm" command to nsupdate to allow
       selection of a non-default realm name.
     * The contributed tool "zkt" was updated to version 1.0.

Security Fixes

9.7.2-P3

     * Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear
       any matching RRSIG records already in cache. A subsequent lookup of
       the cached NO DATA entry could crash named (INSIST) when the
       unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA cache entry.
       [RT #22288] [CVE-2010-3613] [VU#706148]
     * BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
       is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
       is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the
       RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY
       RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm
       rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone
       but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset. [RT
       #22309] [CVE-2010-3614] [VU#837744]
     * When BIND is running as an authoritative server for a zone and
       receives a query for that zone data, it first checks for
       allow-query acls in the zone statement, then in that view, then in
       global options. If none of these exist, it defaults to allowing any
       query (allow-query {"any"};).
       With this bug, if the allow-query is not set in the zone statement,
       it failed to check in view or global options and fell back to the
       default of allowing any query. This means that queries that the
       zone owner did not wish to allow were incorrectly allowed. [RT
       #22418] [CVE-2010-3615] [VU#510208]

9.7.2-P2

     * A flaw where the wrong ACL was applied was fixed. This flaw allowed
       access to a cache via recursion even though the ACL disallowed it.

9.7.2-P1

     * If BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validating server, has two or more
       trust anchors configured in named.conf for the same zone (such as
       example.com) and the response for a record in that zone from the
       authoritative server includes a bad signature, the validating
       server will crash while trying to validate that query.

Bug Fixes

9.7.3

     * BIND now builds with threads disabled in versions of NetBSD earlier
       than 5.0 and with pthreads enabled by default in NetBSD versions
       5.0 and higher. Also removes support for unproven-pthreads,
       mit-pthreads and ptl2. [RT #19203]
     * Added a regression test for fix 2896/RT #21045 ("rndc sign" failed
       to properly update the zone when adding a DNSKEY for publication
       only). [RT #21324]
     * "nsupdate -l" now gives error message if "session.key" file is not
       found. [RT #21670]
     * HPUX now correctly defaults to using /dev/poll, which should
       increase performance. [RT #21919]
     * If named is running as a threaded application, after an "rndc stop"
       command has been issued, other inbound TCP requests can cause named
       to hang and never complete shutdown. [RT #22108]
     * After an "rndc reconfig", the refresh timer for managed-keys is
       ignored, resulting in managed-keys not being refreshed until named
       is restarted. [RT #22296]
     * An NSEC3PARAM record placed inside a zone which is not properly
       signed with NSEC3 could cause named to crash, if changed via
       dynamic update. [RT #22363]
     * "rndc -h" now includes "loadkeys" option. [RT #22493]
     * When performing a GSS-TSIG signed dynamic zone update, memory could
       be leaked. This causes an unclean shutdown and may affect
       long-running servers. [RT #22573]
     * A bug in NetBSD and FreeBSD kernels with SO_ACCEPTFILTER enabled
       allows for a TCP DoS attack. Until there is a kernel fix, ISC is
       disabling SO_ACCEPTFILTER support in BIND. [RT #22589]
     * When signing records, named didn't filter out any TTL changes to
       DNSKEY records. This resulted in an incomplete key set. TTL changes
       are now dealt with before signing. [RT #22590]
     * Corrected a defect where a combination of dynamic updates and zone
       transfers incorrectly locked the in-memory zone database, causing
       named to freeze. [RT #22614]
     * Don't run MX checks (check-mx) when the MX record points to ".".
       [RT #22645]
     * DST key reference counts can now be incremented via dst_key_attach.
       [RT #22672]
     * The IN6_IS_ADDR_LINKLOCAL and IN6_IS_ADDR_SITELOCAL macros in win32
       were updated/corrected per current Windows OS. [RT #22724]
     * "dnssec-settime -S" no longer tests prepublication interval
       validity when the interval is set to 0. [RT #22761]
     * isc_mutex_init_errcheck() in phtreads/mutex.c failed to destroy
       attr. [RT #22766]
     * The Kerberos realm was being truncated when being pulled from the
       the host prinicipal, make krb5-self updates fail. [RT #22770]
     * named failed to preserve the case of domain names in RDATA which is
       not compressible when writing master files. [RT #22863]
     * The man page for dnssec-keyfromlabel incorrectly had "-U" rather
       than the correct option "-I". [RT #22887]
     * The "rndc" command usage statement was missing the "-b" option. [RT
       #22937]
     * There was a bug in how the clients-per-query code worked with some
       query patterns. This could result, in rare circumstances, in having
       all the client query slots filled with queries for the same DNS
       label, essentially ignoring the max-clients-per-query setting. [RT
       #22972]
     * The secure zone update feature in named is based on the zone being
       signed and configured for dynamic updates. A bug in the ACL
       processing for "allow-update { none; };" resulted in a zone that is
       supposed to be static being treated as a dynamic zone. Thus, name
       would try to sign/re-sign that zone erroneously. [RT #23120]

9.7.2-P3

     * Microsoft changed the behavior of sockets between NT/XP based
       stacks vs Vista/windows7 stacks. Server 2003/2008 have the older
       behavior, 2008r2 has the new behavior. With the change, different
       error results are possible, so ISC adapted BIND to handle the new
       error results. This resolves an issue where sockets would shut down
       on Windows servers causing named to stop responding to queries. [RT
       #21906]
     * Windows has non-POSIX compliant behavior in its rename() and
       unlink() calls. This caused journal compaction to fail on Windows
       BIND servers with the log error: "dns_journal_compact failed:
       failure". [RT #22434]

9.7.2-P1

     * A bug, introduced in BIND 9.7.2, caused named to fail to start if a
       master zone file was unreadable or missing. This has been corrected
       in 9.7.2-P1.
     * BIND previously accepted answers from authoritative servers that
       did not provide a "proper" response, such as not setting AA bit.
       BIND was changed to be more strict in what it accepted but this
       caused operational issues. This new strictness has been backed out
       in 9.7.2-P1.

9.7.2

     * Removed a warning message when running BIND 9 under Windows for
       when a TCP connection was aborted. This is a common occurrence and
       the warning was extraneous.
     * Worked around a race condition in the cache database memory
       handling. Without this fix a DNS cache DB or ADB could incorrectly
       stay in an over memory state, effectively refusing further caching,
       which subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable.
     * Partially disabled change 2864 because it would cause infinite
       attempts of RRSIG queries.
     * BIND did not properly handle non-cacheable negative responses from
       insecure zones. This caused several non-protocol-compliant zones to
       become unresolvable. BIND is now more accepting of responses it
       receives from less strict servers.

Known issues in this release

     * "make test" will fail on OSX and possibly other operating systems.
       The failure occurs in a new test to check for allow-query ACLs. The
       failure is caused because the source address is not specified on
       the dig commands issued in the test.
       If running "make test" is part of your usual acceptance process,
       please edit the file bin/tests/system/allow_query/test.sh and add
       -b 10.53.0.2
       to the DIGOPTS line.
