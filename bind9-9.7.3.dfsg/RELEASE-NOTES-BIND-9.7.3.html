					Added new “filter-aaaa-on-v4” access control list to

				 	Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear

					BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
				  is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
				  is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the RRSIG
				  in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY RRset.
				  This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm rollover,
				  when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone but only the
				  new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset.

			   		With this bug, if the allow-query is not set in the zone statement,

				"nsupdate -l" now gives error message if "session.key" file is not

				If named is running as a threaded application, after an "rndc stop"
				command has been issued, other inbound TCP requests can cause named
				to hang and never complete shutdown. [RT #22108]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				After an "rndc reconfig", the refresh timer for managed-keys is ignored, resulting in managed-keys
				not being refreshed until named is restarted. [RT #22296]

When signing records, named didn't filter out any TTL changes
to DNSKEY records. This resulted in an incomplete key set. TTL
changes are now dealt with before signing.

The man page for dnssec-keyfromlabel incorrectly had "-U" rather

The "rndc" command usage statement was missing the "-b" option.

There was a bug in how the clients-per-query code worked with some
query patterns. This could result, in rare circumstances, in having all
the client query slots filled with queries for the same DNS label,
essentially ignoring the max-clients-per-query setting.
[RT #22972]
				</li><li class="listitem">
The secure zone update feature in named is based on the zone
being signed and configured for dynamic updates. A bug in the ACL
processing for "allow-update { none; };" resulted in a zone that is
supposed to be static being treated as a dynamic zone. Thus, name
would try to sign/re-sign that zone erroneously. [RT #23120]
