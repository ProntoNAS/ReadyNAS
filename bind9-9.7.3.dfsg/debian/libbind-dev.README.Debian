The include files for BIND are in /usr/include/{isc,dns,dst,lwres}.  If 
you're compiling something that uses them, use something like 

	'-I/usr/include/isc' 

and so on in the call to the compiler to pick up the BIND versions before 
the normal system versions for files that have conflicting filenames.
