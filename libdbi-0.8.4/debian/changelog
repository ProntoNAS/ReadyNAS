libdbi (0.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommits the changes bellow.
  * Standard-Version is now 3.9.2.
  * Renamed libdbi0-dev to libdbi-dev.

  http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/LAFileRemoval.

  too hard to clean, and upstream doesn't do it correctly.

libdbi (0.8.3+really0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This upload reverts back to 0.8.2 because of an ABI change in the error
    codes as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=594607
    this is only temporary and in SID only in order to not bother anyone that
    has dependencies to libdbi. My appologies to the release team, but to my
    defence, I trusted upstream saying that there was only bugfixes and no
    other change.
  * Still keeping zigo@debian.org as maintainer email.
