.SH NAME
tracker-status \- Provide status and statistics on the data indexed

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtracker status\fR
\fBtracker status\fR \-\-stat [-a] [[\fIexpression1\fR]...]
\fBtracker status\fR \-\-collect\-debug\-info
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Display the status of the current index and data set.

With the \fB\-\-stat\fR option, displays statistics about the RDF
classes and how many of each exist for data set that has been indexed.
For example, "10 Folders".

This command also provides a way to collect information for debug
purposes using the \fB\-\-collect\-debug\-info\fR option.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-stat\fR[=\fIexpression\fR]
By default, only common and useful classes are shown, e.g.
"nfo:Document" or "nfo:Folder", for a full set of statistics, see the
\fB\-\-all\fR option.

If one or more \fIexpression\fR arguments is given, the statistics
returned are filtered to only show information those RDF types
matching \fIexpression\fR (case folded and matching accented
variants). The RDF classes are detailed by the Nepomuk otology
specification. A list of possible classes matching \fIexpression\fR,
see \fBtracker sparql \-c\fR.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Display statistics about ALL RDF classes that exist in the database.
Without this option only the common RDF classes will be shown, for
example "nfo:Document" and "nfo:FileDataObject".

This option is implied if search terms are provided to filter ALL
possible statistics.
.TP
.B \-\-collect\-debug\-info
Useful when debugging problems to diagnose the state of Tracker on
your system. The data is output to stdout. Useful if bugs are filed
against the project itself.

Data collected includes Tracker version in use, disk space available,
size of the databases on the disk, the configuration in use, states of
the index (e.g. last filesystem crawl, data set locale, etc.) and
finally statistics about the data in the database (e.g. how many
"nfo:FileDataObject" resources exist).
