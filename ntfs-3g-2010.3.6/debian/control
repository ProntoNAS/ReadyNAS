Description: read-write NTFS driver for FUSE
 The ntfs-3g driver is an open source, GPL licensed, third generation Linux
 NTFS driver which was implemented by the Linux-NTFS project. It provides
 full read-write access to NTFS, excluding access to encrypted files, writing
 compressed files, changing file ownership, access right.
 .
 Technically it's based on and a major improvement to the third generation
 Linux NTFS driver, ntfsmount. The improvements includes functionality,
 quality and performance enhancements.
 .
 ntfs-3g is based on FUSE (userspace filesystem framework for Linux), thus
 you will have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.
 .
 Fuse is available in any recent kernel. No need to prepare a kernel module
 if you are already running Debian Etch kernel or newer.
