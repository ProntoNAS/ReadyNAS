STABLE Version 2010.1.16 (January 16, 2010)

	Fix: Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 couldn’t access a volume,
	file or directory if it had a non-resident TXF_DATA attribute despite being
	allowed by the NTFS $AttrDef attribute specification file. Solution is also
	available from Microsoft, please see KB974729. Upgrade is recommended!
	Fix: NTFS-3G may crashed if a junction point referred to a non-ASCII filename.
	Fix: Compilation errors on Mac OS X, OpenSolaris and openSUSE.

STABLE Version 2009.11.14 (November 15, 2009)

	New: Full file ownership and permissions support. The ownership and
	permissions of files are interoperable with Windows and conforms to the POSIX
	rules.

	permissions as defined in POSIX.
	New: Optional Windows-type inheritance of ACLs.
	New: Full extended attributes support for all namespaces: user, system,
	security and trusted.
	New: Junction points support. The junction points and symbolic links created
	by Windows are seen as symbolic links.

STABLE Version 2009.4.4 (April 2, 2009)
	Fix: Mount and system boot could hang if Linux kernel audit was enabled.
	Fix: Volume could be potentially corrupted or the driver crashed after a
	partial write or hardware error.
	Fix: The driver could crash handling highly fragmented files.

STABLE Version 2009.3.8 (March 26, 2009)
	Fix: Some defragmenters reported NTFS-3G created directories unmovable.
	Fix: The Windows NTFS file system checker, CHKDSK, may reported "free space
	marked as allocated in the master file table (MFT) bitmap".
	Fix: The driver may returned "No space left on device" error when there was
	still free space on the NTFS volume.
	Fix: A file may got corrupted when the STANDARD INFORMATION attribute was
	moved to an extent MFT record. Only the already fixed Advanced NTFS-3G
	Driver had this problem, not the Stable NTFS-3G Driver.
	Change: 10-50% faster file and directory creation, removal, copy,
	unpackaging performance.
	Change: 500-1000% faster mount time. This is mostly noticable on multi-TB
	volumes and embedded devices. Please note, a generally 10-20 times faster
	performing NTFS-3G driver is available for embedded devices separately.
	Change: Improved multi-cluster allocation, non-aligned file write
	performance.
	Change: Improved volume consistency and recovery if the storage device was
	unsafely detached or powered down.
	Change: Less disk space usage.
	New: The version/-V command line option has been added.

STABLE Version 2009.2.1 (February 12, 2009) -- Release Notes
	New: The 'recover' and 'norecover' mount options were introduced. The former
	option will casue the driver to recover and repair a corrupted or
	inconsistent NTFS volume if it's possible. The default behaviour is
	'recover'.
	Fix: The driver may crashed when it tried to read a highly fragmented file
	or directory which was either corrupted or it was unreadable due to a
	hardware error. Upgrade is recommended.
	Fix: The driver incorrectly returned 'Permission denied' error message if a
	requested extended attribute namespace wasn't supported.
	Fix: The lack of file backup timestamp support confused some applications on
	OS X.
	Change: The user extended attribute namespace is supported by default on
	Linux.
	Change: A volume having unclean journal file is recovered and mounted by
	default. The 'norecover' mount option can be used to disable this behavior.

STABLE Version 2009.1.1 (January 22, 2009) -- Release Notes
	New: Built-in, transparent UTF-8 conversion support. This solves all the
	problems, described here, and even more with hidden and inaccessible
	filenames having national characters.
	New: Support getting/setting the file creation timestamp on OS X.
	Fix: An extended attribute got corrupted if the new attribute size was
	smaller than the original size.
	Fix: Memory leaked if an extended attribute or alternate data stream
	couldn't be opened.
	Fix: Report an error if a filename can not be listed during reading a
	directory.
	Change: The 'locale=' mount option is not used anymore for filename
	characterset conversion. Instead filenames are always converted to UTF-8.

TEST Version 1.5222-RC (December 22, 2008) -- Release Notes
	New: Built-in, transparent UTF-8 conversion support.
	Fix: Report an error if a filename can not be listed during reading a
	directory.
	Change: The 'locale=' mount option is not used anymore for filename
	characterset conversion. Instead filenames are always converted to UTF-8.

STABLE Version 1.5130 (November 30, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: Reading a data storage with permanent or temporary physical damage,
	or a partial read(2) system call could result ignoring the low level
	hardware error and returning invalid data. Upgrade is recommended.

STABLE Version 1.5012 (October 12, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Version 1.2926-RC is released unchanged as stable. The NTFS-3G driver is
	able for unlimited file and directory creation and removal as the result of
	13 years continuous development with the help of hundreds of contributors
	over these years. Congratulations And Thank You To Everybody Who Made It
	Happen!

TEST Version 1.2926-RC (September 19, 2008) -- Release Notes
	New: Support unlimited file and directory creation. Successfully tested the
	creation of 54 million (54,000,000) files in a single directory, besides the
	other test cases.

STABLE Version 1.2918 (September 18, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: A corrupted directory index entry could hang the driver instead of
	returning "I/O error".

STABLE Version 1.2812 (August 15, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: The allocation size of an attribute may got corrupted if the attribute
	size change failed.
	Fix: An MFT record could leak on big-endian CPUs if adding a new attribute
	failed.
	Fix: The system log was flooded if a transparently compressed or encypted
	file was tried to be updated repeatedly.
	New: Solaris support.
	New: Libtool-2 support.
	Change: No external dependency on librt anymore when internal FUSE is used
	(default on Linux).
	Change: The default compiler is gcc.
	Change: Internal FUSE further shrank by 10%.

STABLE Version 1.2712 (July 12, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: A corrupted size directory or a directory over tens of million files
	may hang the driver. If NTFS-3G is compiled with an external FUSE library
	(non-default on Linux) then FUSE CVS is needed until FUSE 2.8.0 is released.
	Fix: Removing alternate data streams and extended attributes leaked memory.
	Fix: Mount could fail with some mount(8) utilities (e.g. busybox one) if the
	/etc/mtab file didn't exist or was on a read-only file system. This fix
	should solve most of the "/bin/mount: invalid option -i" mount problems.
	If NTFS-3G is compiled with an external FUSE library (non-default on Linux)
	then FUSE CVS is needed until FUSE 2.8.0 is released.
	Fix: The driver always returned "I/O errors" if the standard file
	descriptors were closed during mount, e.g. via some usage of udev, hotplug,
	etc.
	Fix: Building the driver failed if the --prefix=/ configure option was used.
	Fix: Driver compilation may failed with 'PATH_MAX undeclared' error mesage
	in some (cross)-compilation environments.

STABLE Version 1.2531 (May 29, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: Mount failed with "Invalid argument" error message if the mountpoint
	was a symlink. If NTFS-3G is compiled with an external FUSE library
	(non-default on Linux) then FUSE CVS is needed until FUSE 2.8.0 is released.
	Fix: A corrupted directory could hang the driver.
	Fix: Mount could hang if the block allocation map was corrupted.
	Fix: The driver could hang or misbehave when compressed, sparse or encrypted
	file attribute flags were corrupted.
	Fix: The driver could crash when both an MFT attribute offset and the
	allocated bytes were corrupted.
	Fix: Building the driver failed if the --exec-prefix configure option was
	used without --sbindir=/sbin.
	Fix: Parallel 'make install' may failed.
	New: Support building the driver in a separate directory.
	New: Added --enable-mount-helper configure option which installs
	/sbin/mount.ntfs-3g, so mount via mount(8) and /etc/fstab can work on Linux.
	The default is enabled on Linux and disabled on all other operating systems.

STABLE Version 1.2506 (May 6, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: In certain, rare circumstances, any area of the NTFS volume, except the
	NTFS boot sector, could get corrupted. The chance for this to happen is
	higher for close to full disk utilization and using one of the more
	uncommon, less than 4096 byte cluster sizes. The cluster size is logged
	under the /var/logs directory usually in the 'messages' or 'daemon.log' log
	file, as the blksize mount parameter. All stable releases have this issue
	since version 1.328.
	Upgrade is strongly recommended from all NTFS-3G releases.

STABLE Version 1.2412 (April 12, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: The total file system depth was limited to 4095 characters by FUSE and
	trying to access files and directories deeper gave "No such file or
	directory" error. If NTFS-3G is compiled with an external FUSE library
	(non-default), then FUSE CVS is needed until FUSE 2.8.0 is released.
	Fix: The symlink(2) system call failed or the size was truncated at modulo
	256 if the old path was over 255 bytes.
	Fix: Unprivileged mount may have been denied because supplementary groups
	were dropped too early as a security measure.
	Fix: Unprivileged mount may have been denied if the /etc/fuse.conf file
	wasn't properly configured. This was redundant and the /etc/fuse.conf file
	is not required anymore.
	Fix: Updating hard link attributes was delayed by one second which resulted
	softwares seeing their file sizes and timestamps incorrectly during this
	time interval.
	Fix: The 'noatime' mount option additionally and unconditionally was passed
	to FUSE.

STABLE Version 1.2310 (March 10, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: the driver crashed when one tried to open a non-existent file which had
	at least twice as long file name as the one allowed by the NTFS
	specification.
	Fix: Windows CHKDSK may reported minor inconsistencies because the data and
	allocation size of some special purpose resident unnamed $DATA attribute in
	the index and inode FILE_NAME attributes could be incorrect.
	Fix: unprivileged mount failed if user had rights for everything except the
	FUSE device file.
	Fix: the 'dev' and 'suid' mount options didn't work.
	Change: rmdir(2) returns ENOTEMPTY instead of EEXIST because the GNOME glib
	library and the Nautilus file browser can't handle the also standard EEXIST
	value which resulted an error message when for instance one tried to remove
	a directory containing files.
	Change: the 'dev' and 'suid' mount options are the default from now on for
	root mounts, similarly as other file systems behave. These options are
	always denied for setuid-root and unprivileged mounts.

STABLE Version 1.2216 (February 16, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: file and directory removal, rename and move may have been denied with
	an "Operation not supported" error message.
	Fix: setuid-root ntfs-3g had a local root exploit and other security
	problems.
	From now on unprivileged mounts of block devices are possible only with
	using the integrated FUSE library (default) which has no known security
	problem.
	Fix: unprivileged unmount didn't always work.
	Fix: create mount.ntfs-3g symlink always in /sbin where mount(8) needs it.
	New: added 'remove_hiberfile' mount option to be able to read/write mount
	hibernated volumes for recovery and troubleshooting purposes.
	Change: keep shrinking driver size.

STABLE Version 1.2129 (January 29, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Version 1.2125-RC is released unchanged as stable.

Version 1.2125-RC (January 24, 2008) -- Release Notes
	Fix: the 1.2121-RC test release didn't compile on 64-bit architectures.

Version 1.2121-RC (January 21, 2008) -- Release Notes
	New: added ntfs-3g.probe utility which probes a volume for read-only or
	read-write mountability.
	New: to facilitate the use of the NTFS-3G driver in scripts, an exit code is
	returned to give an indication of the mountability status of the volume.
	Zero value means success, and all other ones mean an error. The unique error
	codes are documented in the ntfs-3g.probe manual page.
	New: built-in FUSE support by using a stripped down, integrated FUSE
	library. Linux uses this by default which means NTFS-3G doesn't require the
	installation of the FUSE package, only FUSE kernel support.
	New: the --with-fuse=external configure option makes NTFS-3G to be compiled
	with an external FUSE library. For non-Linux operating systems this is the
	default and the only compilation option.
	New: README file is installed as documentation.
	New: the --enable-ldscript configure option uses ldscript instead of .so
	symlink.
	New: added libntfs-3g.pc.in pkg-config and libntfs-3g.script.so.in ldconfig
	files.
	Change: rewritten, backwards compatible build system.
	Change: use 'make install-strip' instead of 'make strip'.
	Fix: the SIGTERM signal may caused deadlock which could block for instance
	the shutdown process. If NTFS-3G is used with an external FUSE library,
	which is not the default, then FUSE 2.7.2 package is required.

STABLE Version 1.1120 (November 20, 2007) -- Release Notes
	Fix: successful hard link removal may reported "Input/Output error".
	Fix: listing the content of a single directory having over 600,000 files
	and subdirectories may returned "Input/Output error" or truncated directory
	listing.
	Fix: atime mount option didn't work.
	Fix: POSIX file time updates (file access and modification times, inode
	change time). Please note, though NTFS-3G updates the times correctly now,
	FUSE may keep caching old, invalid time attributes for a short time after
	rename(2), creat(2), and some file operations which involve hard links. FUSE
	has fixed already the first two cases and they may be included in the Linux
	kernel 2.6.24 release.
	New: relatime support was added and made the default atime update method.

STABLE Version 1.1104 (November 4, 2007) -- Release Notes
	Fix: reads over the end of a file could return "invalid argument" error
	using some recent kernels. This problem may have caused Thunderbird to
	hang.
	Fix: some faulty versions of the gcc compiler have crashed during
	compilation.
	Fix: the utimes(2) system call may incorrectly updated the last status
	change filestamp.
	Change: the ntfs.streams.list extended attribute enumerates Alternate
	Data Streams (ADS) '\0' separated.

STABLE Version 1.1030 (October 29, 2007) -- Release Notes
	Fix: big-endian problems exposed by the NTFS-3G Test Suite.
	Fix: free space calculation may was wrong for >1 TB volumes.
	Fix: some faulty Thunderbird versions caused system log flooding.
	Fix: uClibc and uClinux improvements.
	Fix: logging improvements.
	Fix: many other minor fixes.

STABLE Version 1.1004 (October 4, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: unwritten sparse file regions could get corrupted if the end of a write
	wasn't aligned to cluster boundary. Sparse files are very rarely used, most
	typically by bittorent clients.
	fix: creation of read-only files failed.
	change: free inode calculation was CPU intensive during write activity. This
	could reduce write performance when millions of files are used if a file
	manager or desktop applet regularly polled for disk space usage. Now the
	statfs() system call is constant time.
	change: file creation performance is improved by 40-80%.
	change: smart directory traversal is 20-200% faster for disk based and
	300-600% faster for memory cache based traversals.

STABLE Version 1.913 (September 13, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: hibernation check was too rigid and mount was refused in read/write
	mode unnecessarily in some cases.
	change: free disk space calculation was highly CPU intensive during write
	activity. This could reduce write performance severely, especially for huge
	volumes if a file manager or desktop applet regularly polled for disk space
	usage. Now the calculation is constant time, around only 10 microseconds on
	a typical desktop, and it's completely independent of the volume size.
	all performance improvements included unchanged from the 1.910-RC test
	release. Please see those details below.

Version 1.910-RC (September 10, 2007) -- Release Notes
	change: significantly improved the performance of writing many files,
	typically by 50-1000% (copying files, unpacking, untarring packages,
	compilation, directory synchronization, ...).
	change: improved the performance of writing multi-GB size files,
	particularly after the creation of many thousands of other files. Previous
	disk space defragmentation is highly advised for the best possible speed.
	File level defragmentation is not enough.
	change: improved concurrent write performance.

STABLE Version 1.826 (August 26, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: utime() also updated the timestamp of the parent directory but it
	shouldn't have (rsync, backup tool problems).
	fix: ignore the "volume dirty" bit because its real meaning is "check the
	volume". The fact of the real dirtiness is stored in the NTFS logfile which
	is already checked for.
	fix: compilation failed with glibc 2.7
	new: the --disable-library 'configure' option can be used not to install but
	link libntfs-3g into the ntfs-3g binary. This decreases the binary size by
	about 10-15% and increases performance by about 2-5%.

STABLE Version 1.810 (August 10, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: file rename may updated the modification time of some files and
	directories which caused some backup tools, like rsync, not to preserve
	always this timestamp
	fix: unmount (fusermount -u) was denied for an unprivileged user who was
	allowed to mount a block device. FUSE 2.7.0+ user space package is required
	for the full fix.
	fix: the driver could hang if there wasn't enough memory during reading a
	large directory
	fix: reading a directory may reported success when there was an error
	fix: metadata update error was ignored in some very rare cases during
	writing a file
	fix: permissions checking was turned on if umask, fmask and dmask was set to
	the default 000 value
	change: manual update, added Windows filename compatibility section
	change: lots of logging improvements

STABLE Version 1.710 (July 10, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: move, rename and hard link could return "input/output error"
	fix: very rare, recoverable directory corruption
	fix: portability improvements
	change: more troubleshooting hints if a volume can't be mounted
	change: logging improvements

STABLE Version 1.616 (June 17, 2007) -- Release Notes
	Version 1.612-RC is released as stable

Version 1.612-RC (June 12, 2007) Release Notes
	new: install executables to the root file system otherwise mount could fail
	during boot
	fix: any kind of file size change failure returned "Operation not
	permitted"
	fix: file close failure was not always reported
	fix: unmount failure was not always reported
	fix: file creation always gave "input/output error" if the $MFT Bitmap
	wasn't up-to-date
	fix: converting very long file names to Unicode may failed
	fix: syslog messages didn't show the low level error detail
	fix: compilation improvements on OS X and NetBSD

STABLE Version 1.516 (May 16, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: Linux security exploit if ntfs-3g was setuid and the FUSE kernel driver
	wasn't loaded yet during mount

STABLE Version 1.417 (April 16, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: mount failed if the -v (verbose) command line option was passed by
	mount(8)

STABLE Version 1.416 (April 16, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: parsing of the first mount option could fail in the 1.411-RC test release

Version 1.411-RC (April 11, 2007) -- Release Notes
	new: read-write mount is supported using the "force" mount option if the
	logfile is unclean
	new: libntfs-3g is versioned
	fix: default ownership of files weren't always set to the mounting user
	fix: mount was denied if the NTFS Master File Table copy had non-standard
	size
	fix: catch and deny all junction/reparse point write operations
	fix: multiply -o options weren't allowed (FreeBSD's mount(8) requires this)
	fix: don't try to run Linux specific code on non-Linux OSes

STABLE Version 1.328 (March 28, 2007) -- Release Notes
	change: document and release version update to stable status

Version 1.320-RC (March 20, 2007) -- Release Notes
	fix: fakeraid/softraid detection was incorrect
	change: major performance improvement for writing large files (new block
	allocator)
	change: manual update, added access handling, security section
	new: use the 'nonempty' FUSE mount option by default, so the driver behaves
	as the in-kernel file systems
	new: --disable-ldconfig configure option

	or dmask mount option is used

Version 0.20070118-BETA: -- Release Notes
	new: top request: setuid root support, the driver can run unprivileged
	fix: the 'user' and 'users' fstab mount options didn't work (requires setuid
	root ntfs-3g)
	fix: time of last file modification and status change weren't updated

Version 0.20070116-BETA: -- Release Notes
	new: top request: support old FUSE kernel modules
	fix: ActiveSync didn't work via Samba 3.0

Version 0.20070102-BETA: -- Release Notes

	fix: writing several files at the same time could be very slow
	fix: writing at several places into a file at the same time could be very
	slow
	fix: invalid argument error when writing randomly into sparse files

Version 0.20061218-BETA: -- Release Notes

	fix: inode number wasn't filled in the dirent structures (CVS, getcwd,
	gnulib problems)
	fix: 2-8% speed increase due to using pread/pwrite instead of lseek+
	read/write
	fix: fuse 2.6.x kernel module detection wasn't reliable
