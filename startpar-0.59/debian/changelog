startpar (0.58-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Undo renaming done in 0.58-2, and instead conflict with sysvinit-utils,
    to avoid inconsistent upstart configuration during upgrades.
    No need for postinst code to remove /etc/init/startpar-injector.conf,
    which was never installed by mistake.  This version breaks/replaces
    sysvinit-utils (<< 2.88dsf-52) to take over the files
    /usr/share/man/man8/startpar-upstart-inject.8.gz,
    /usr/share/man/man8/startpar.8.gz and
    /etc/init/startpar-bridge.conf from that soon to be uploaded package.
