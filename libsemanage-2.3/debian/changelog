libsemanage (2.0.25-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * [bab6644]: Also check for the uppoer bound on user ids in login.defs

    Some non-Debian packages (like qmail, shudder) create
    users not below MIN_UID, but above MAX_UID, in /etc/login.defs
    (non-system users are supposed to have uids between MIN_UID and
    MAX_UID.

    genhomedircon.c:gethomedirs() checks pwent.pw_uid against MIN_UID in
    /etc/login.defs to exclude system users from generating homedir
    contexts. But unfortunately it does not check it against MAX_UID
    setting from the same file. This gets us lines like the following in
    the contexts/files/file_contexts.homedirs file:
    ,----
    | #
    | # Home Context for user user_u

libsemanage (1.6.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream point release
    * Merged netfilter contexts support from Chris PeBenito.
  * Moved the package over to the new python policy. This means that the old
    python2.4-semanage package is now a virtual package, and now we provide
    python packages for all supported versions of python, determining the
    depends and the provides relationships of the python package
    dynamically. The build depends has been changed to acoomodate it. The
    package uses the python-support utility to help with byte compilation
    and other modules handling.                              (Closes: #380865)
  * Python transition (#2): you are building a private python module !
  * Bug fix: "setup.py file for building the python extension", thanks to
    Matthias Klose. Thanks for the hint about -z,defs; however, I have
    elected to stick close to the upstream Makefile and not use setup.py.

libsemanage (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    * Updated version for release.
    * Changed semanage_handle_create() to set do_reload based on
      is_selinux_enabled().  This prevents improper attempts to
      load policy on a non-SELinux system.
    * Dropped handle from user_del_role interface.
    * Removed defrole interfaces.
    * Merged Makefile python definitions patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Removed is_selinux_mls_enabled() conditionals in seusers and users
      file parsers.
    * Merged wrap char*** for user_get_roles patch from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged remove defrole from sepol patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged swig wrappers for modifying users and seusers from Joshua Brindle.
    * Fixed free->key_free bug.
    * Merged clear obsolete patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged modified swigify patch from Dan Walsh
      (original patch from Joshua Brindle).
    * Merged move genhomedircon call patch from Chad Sellers.
    * Merged move seuser validation patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged hidden declaration fixes from Ivan Gyurdiev,
      with minor corrections.
    * Merged cleanup patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
      This renames semanage_module_conn to semanage_direct_handle,
      and moves sepol handle create/destroy into semanage handle
      create/destroy to allow use even when disconnected (for the
      record interfaces).
    * Clear modules modified flag upon disconnect and commit.
    * Added tracking of module modifications and use it to
      determine whether expand-time checks should be applied
      on commit.
    * Reverted semanage_set_reload_bools() interface.
    * Disabled calls to port dbase for merge and commit and stubbed
      out calls to sepol_port interfaces since they are not exported.
    * Merged rename instead of copy patch from Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Added hidden_def/hidden_proto for exported symbols used within
      libsemanage to eliminate relocations.  Wrapped type definitions
      in exported headers as needed to avoid conflicts.  Added
      src/context_internal.h and src/iface_internal.h.
    * Added semanage_is_managed() interface to allow detection of whether
      the policy is managed via libsemanage.  This enables proper handling
      in setsebool for non-managed systems.
    * Merged semanage_set_reload_bools() interface from Ivan Gyurdiev,
      to enable runtime control over preserving active boolean values
      versus reloading their saved settings upon commit.
    * Merged seuser parser resync, dbase tracking and cleanup, strtol
      bug, copyright, and assert space patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added src/*_internal.h in preparation for other changes.
    * Added hidden/hidden_proto/hidden_def to src/debug.[hc] and
      src/seusers.[hc].
    * Merged interface parse/print, context_to_string interface change,
      move assert_noeof, and order preserving patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added src/dso.h in preparation for other changes.
    * Merged install seusers, handle/error messages, MLS parsing,
      and seusers validation patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged record interface, dbase flush, common database code,
      and record bugfix patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged dbase policydb list and count change from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged enable dbase and set relay patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged query APIs and dbase_file_set patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged sepol handle passing, seusers support, and policydb cache
      patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged resync to sepol changes and booleans fixes/improvements
      patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged support for genhomedircon/homedir template, store selection,
      explicit policy reload, and semanage.conf relocation from Joshua
      Brindle.
    * Merged resync to sepol changes and transaction fix patches from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged reorganize users patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged remove unused relay functions patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Fixed policy file leaks in semanage_load_module and

    * Merged policy component patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Renamed 'check=' configuration value to 'expand-check=' for
      clarity.
    * Changed semanage_commit_sandbox to check for and report errors
      on rename(2) calls performed during rollback.
    * Added optional check= configuration value to semanage.conf
      and updated call to sepol_expand_module to pass its value
      to control assertion and hierarchy checking on module expansion.
    * Merged fixes for make DESTDIR= builds from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged default database from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged removal of connect requirement in policydb backend from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged commit locking fix and lock rename from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged transaction rollback in lock patch from Joshua Brindle.
    * Changed default args for load_policy to be null, as it no longer
      takes a pathname argument and we want to preserve booleans.
    * Merged move local dbase initialization patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged acquire/release read lock in databases patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged rename direct -> policydb as appropriate patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added calls to sepol_policy_file_set_handle interface prior
      to invoking sepol operations on policy files.
    * Updated call to sepol_policydb_from_image to pass the handle.
    * Merged user and port APIs - policy database patch from Ivan
      Gyurdiev.

      from using buffers to using sepol handles for error reporting, and
      changed direct_connect/disconnect to create/destroy sepol handles.
    * Merged bugfix patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged seuser database patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
      Merged direct user/port databases to the handle from Ivan Gyurdiev.

      Merged seuser record patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged boolean and interface databases from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Updated to use get interfaces for hidden sepol_module_package type.
    * Changed semanage_expand_sandbox and semanage_install_active
      to generate/install the latest policy version supported	by libsepol
      by default (unless overridden by semanage.conf), since libselinux
      will now downgrade automatically for load_policy.
    * Merged new callback-based error reporting system and ongoing
      database work from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Fixed semanage_install_active() to use the same logic for
      selecting a policy version as semanage_expand_sandbox().  Dropped
      dead code from semanage_install_sandbox().
    * Updated for changes to libsepol, and to only use types and interfaces
      provided by the shared libsepol.
    * Merged further database work from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged iterate, redistribute, and dbase split patches from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
