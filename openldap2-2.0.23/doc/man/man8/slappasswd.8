.SH NAME
slappasswd \- OpenLDAP password utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B SBINDIR/slappasswd
.B [\-v]
.B [\-u]
.B [\-s secret]
.B [\-h hash]
.B [\-c salt-format]
.B 
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slappasswd
is used to generate an userPassword value
suitable for use with
.BR ldapmodify (1)
or
.BR slapd.conf (5)
.I rootpw
configuration directive.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-u
Generate RFC2307 userPassword values (the default).  Future
versions of this program may generate alternative syntaxes
by default.  This option is provided for forward compatibility.
.TP
.BI \-s " secret"
The secret to hash.  If not provided, the user will be prompted
for the secret to hash.
.TP
.BI \-h " scheme"
If -h is specified, one of the following RFC2307 schemes may
be specified:
.IR {CRYPT} ,
.IR {MD5} ,
.IR {SMD5} ,
.IR {SSHA} ", and"
.IR {SHA} .
The default is 
.IR {SSHA} .
.TP
.BI \-c " crypt-salt-format"
Specify the format of the salt passed to
.BR crypt (3)
when generating {CRYPT} passwords.  
This string needs to be in
.BR sprintf (3)
format and may include one (and only one) %s conversion.
This conversion will be substituted with a string random
characters from [A\-Za\-z0\-9./].  For example, "%.2s"
provides a two character salt and "$1$%.8s" tells some
versions of crypt(3) to use an MD5 algorithm and provides
8 random characters of salt.  The default is "%s", which
provides 31 characters of salt.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The practice storing hashed passwords in userPassword violates
Standard Track (RFC2256) schema specifications and may hinder
interoperability.  A new attribute type to hold hashed
passwords is needed.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during
protocol transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections
should be inplace before using LDAP simple bind.  The
hashed password values should be protected as if they
were clear text passwords.
