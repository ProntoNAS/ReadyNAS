This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU file
management utilities.

This package is maintained by Michael Stone <mstone@debian.org> and
built from sources obtained from:
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/fileutils/fileutils-4.1.tar.gz

This debian package was first put together by Ian Murdock
<imurdock@debian.org>, from fileutils-3.12.  It was later maintained
by Erick Branderhorst <branderh@debian.org> and Galen Hazelwood
<galenh@micron.net>.  Certain patches and bug-fixes made by the
previous maintainers have since been integrated into the upstream
source.

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * install.c: Added extra options to invocation of strip
 * minor documentation changes
 * at times, bug fixes awaiting inclusion in the upstream source
