/* When we pass a Unicode character to iconv(), we must pass it in a
   suitable encoding. The standardized Unicode encodings are
   UTF-8, UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-7.
   UCS-2 supports only characters up to \U0000FFFF.
   UTF-16 and variants support only characters up to \U0010FFFF.
   UTF-7 is way too complex and not supported by glibc-2.1.
   UCS-4 specification leaves doubts about endianness and byte order
   mark. glibc currently interprets it as big endian without byte order
   mark, but this is not backed by an RFC.
   So we use UTF-8. It supports characters up to \U7FFFFFFF and is
   unambiguously defined.  */
