The tarball distributed by Debian is a modified version of the tarball
provided by upstream, where the files rfc3986.htm, rfc3513.htm, and
rfc3986_grammar_only.txt have been removed from the doc/ subdirectory
because they're not available under a DFSG-compliant license.

A script to automatically perform these removals is provided in
debian/prune-tarball.sh.
