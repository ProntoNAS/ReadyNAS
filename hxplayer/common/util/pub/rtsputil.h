/*
 * Function: 
 * 		BinTo64
 *
 * Purpose:
 *		Encode binary data into text using 64 characters from
 *		the ANSI character set a base 64 values. Essentially
 *		encodes 24 bits (3 bytes) into 4 6-bit base64 characters.
 *
 * Parameters:	
 *		pInBuf - pointer to buffer of binary data to be encoded
 *              len - length of data to be encoded
 *              pOutBuf - pointer to output buffer
 *
 * Returns:
 *		length of encoded buffer
 *
 * Notes: 
 *		The output buffer should be about 33% larger than the input
 *        	buffer to hold the encoded data. Text is broken up into
 *              72 character lines.

 * Purpose:

 *		the ANSI character set a base 64 values. Essentially
 *		encodes 24 bits (3 bytes) into 4 6-bit base64 characters.
 *
 *              Note: This function differs from BinTo64 in that the '*' and
 *              '!' characters are used instead of the "/" and "+" chars. 
 *              This is useful if the encoded string is going to be used as
 *              a URL parameter. The same BinFrom64 function can be used to
 *              decode both encodings.
 *
 * Parameters:	
 *		pInBuf - pointer to buffer of binary data to be encoded
 *              len - length of data to be encoded

 *              pOutBuf - pointer to output buffer

 * Notes: 
 *		The output buffer should be 3 times larger than the input
 *        	buffer to hold the encoded data. Each illegal URL character
 *              will be translated to 3 characters (i.e. @ -> %40). The

 * Notes:

 *		pInBuf - pointer to buffer of escaped data
 *		len - length of data to be decoded

 *
