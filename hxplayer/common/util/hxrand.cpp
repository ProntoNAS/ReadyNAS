**
** This random number generator (RNG) was found in the ALGORITHMS Notesfile.
**
** (Note 16.7, July 7, 1989 by Robert (RDVAX::)Gries, Cambridge Research Lab,
**  Computational Quality Group)
**
** It is really a "Multiple Prime Random Number Generator" (MPRNG) and is
** completely discussed in reference #1 (see below).
**
**   References:
**   1) "The Multiple Prime Random Number Generator" by Alexander Hass
**      pp. 368 to 381 in ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,
**      December, 1987
**   2) "The Art of Computer Programming: Seminumerical Algorithms
**      (vol 2)" by Donald E. Knuth, pp. 39 to 113.
**
** A summary of the notesfile entry follows:
**
** Gries discusses the two RNG's available for ULTRIX-C.  The default RNG
** uses a Linear Congruential Method (very popular) and the second RNG uses
** a technique known as a linear feedback shift register.
**
** The first (default) RNG suffers from bit-cycles (patterns/repetition),
** ie. it's "not that random."
**
** While the second RNG passes all the emperical tests, there are "states"
** that become "stable", albeit contrived.
**
** Gries then presents the MPRNG and says that it passes all emperical
** tests listed in reference #2.  In addition, the number of calls to the
** MPRNG before a sequence of bit position repeats appears to have a normal
** distribution.
**
** Note (mbs): I have coded the Gries's MPRNG with the same constants that
** he used in his paper.  I have no way of knowing whether they are "ideal"
** for the range of numbers we are dealing with.
