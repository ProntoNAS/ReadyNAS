This directory should build some unit test executables.

Each test should be run with it's correspoding test case input file.
For example, to run the 'tmap' test you would type 'tmap tmap.in'. If the
test succeeds you will get a message that says 'Unit test PASSED'. If a
test fails, information will be printed out about where the failure occured
in the test. 

tmap : Tests CHXMapPtrToPtr, CHXMapStringToOb, CHXMapStringToString, 
       CHXMapLongToObj, and CHXMapGUIDToObj. It tests all of these maps at
       the same time and insures that they are all behave in the same way.

tptrarray : Tests CHXPtrArray

tslist : Tests CHXSimpleList

tstrlist : Tests CHXStringList

tstring : Tests CHXString

pmap : Started as a copy of 'tmap' whose intention is to run commands
       against one map type or another in order to be able to profile the
       execution time.  This program is incomplete!
