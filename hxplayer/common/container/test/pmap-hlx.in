# Note: Rhs[] represents using the [] operator on the right hand side
#       of an expression. For example:  value = map[key];
# Rhs[] <index> <0 = item not in map, 1 = item in map>

# Note: Lhs[] represents using the [] operator on the left hand side

# Lhs[] <index>

# Note: IsNull should only be used on keys that are in the map.
#       It is intended to test the case where Rhs[] inserts a value
#       into the map when it is not already present
# IsNull <index> <0 = map value is not null, 1 = map value is null>
