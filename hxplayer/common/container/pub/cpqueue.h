/*******************************************************************
 *
 *	NAME:	CPQueue.h
 *
 *	CLASS:
 *		CPtrQueue class declaration.
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *		Class declaration for a 'Queue of pointers' object.
 *		This object inherits from the CByteQueue object by
 *		overriding the GetElementSize() method, and
 *		defining it's own assignemt operator.
 *
 *	NOTES (from CByteQueue):
 *		The only time a subclass MUST provide a virtual override
 *		is for the GetElementSize() method when the subclass changes
 *		the size of queued elements.  All other virtual methods
 *		provide fully functional default behavior that will ramain
 *		functional even when the ElementSize changes.
 *
 *		The assignment operator is one of the few cases where a
 *		subclass will need to provide new functionality by virtue of
 *		inheriting from the base.  Subclasses should use the base
 *		method for assigning the bits of the base class prior to
 *		performing their own assignment related operations.
 *
