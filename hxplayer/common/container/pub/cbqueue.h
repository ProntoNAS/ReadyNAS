 *	NAME:	CBQueue.h
 *
 *	CLASS:
 *		CByteQueue class declaration.
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *		Class declaration for a 'Queue of bytes' object.
 *		This object is meant to serve the needs of either clients as
 *		an abstract object, or of subclasses as a base object.
 *
 *		That is a client may use this instances of this class directly,
 *		or they may inherit from the class and provide expanded
 *		functionality.
 *
 *	NOTES:
 *		See the CPQueue.h file for an example of a minimal subclass
 *		that changes the size of the queue'd items.
 *
 *		The only time a subclass MUST provide a virtual override
 *		is for the GetElementSize() method when the subclass changes
 *		the size of queued elements.  All other virtual methods
 *		provide fully functional default behavior that will ramain
 *		functional even when the ElementSize changes.
 *
 *		The assignment operator is one of the few cases where a
 *		subclass will need to provide new functionality by virtue of
 *		inheriting from the base.  Subclasses should use the base
 *		method for assigning the bits of the base class prior to
 *		performing their own assignment related operations.
