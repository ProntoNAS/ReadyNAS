Change Log:
12/15/1999

We created a "loose" mode the parser can run in.  When the parser is set
to use this "loose" mode, it will allow ampersands (&) in attribute.

This involved creating two new API functions to set up the parser, and
modifing the parameter list of the many of the scanning functions.

These changes are all ifdefed.  Compiling expat with RNXML_STRICT_FLAG
activates these new changes.

We backed out the loose mode changes, so the code is closer to the expat
source.

I also checked in diffs that we are going of our error handling changes
that can be put on our web stite to fullfill our legal requirements.
