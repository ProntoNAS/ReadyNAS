class CHXFileSpecifier;
class CHXDirSpecifier;

// this utility class helps out the two classes below.  It breaks a path up into these components:
//
//  C:/dir1/dir2/dir3/file.ext
//  ^ ^              ^^   ^^
//
// Each arrow above points to the start of a component.  The components are:
//
// volume
// parent [path]
// separator [note: this may be more than one character, for instance:  c:/dir1////file1.txt, which is equivalent to c:/dir1/file1.txt]
// name [for a file, the filename, for a directory, the directory name
// extension separator [I think this is always a single '.']
// extension [note that even directories may have extensions].
//
// Here are some special cases that are handled:
//
// /dir1/dir2/  -- a path with no volume, and trailing slash.
//
//     volume: ""
//     parent: "/dir1"
//     separator: "/"
//     name: "dir2"
//     extension separator: ""
//     extension: ""
//
// \\hostname\drive_1\dev\file1.
//
//     volume: "\\hostname"
//     parent: "\drive_1\dev"
//     separator: "\"
//     name: "file1"
//     extension separator: "."
//     extension: ""
//
// C:bogus.txt -- relative path, no directory
//
//     volume: "C:"
//     parent: ""
//     separator: ""
//     name: "bogus"
//     extension separator: "."
//     extension: "txt"
