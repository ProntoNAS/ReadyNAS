"""Singleton class to provide some logging functionality.

    As a singleton, do not instantiate __Log objects directly.
    
    Static hooks are provided.
    Use the following methods directly:
    initLogging() - Sets up logging. Must be run before log calls will
                         write to any files.
                      This should be called once in the highest level of the
                      executing process. Each time this is called, logging will
                      begin writing to a new batch of logfiles. Typically, this
                      should be the first thing any executing script does, and
                      then *never* do this from within imports.
    
    debug()       - Use to log everything.
    error()       - Use to log an error message.
    info()        - Use to log a non-error message, typically what you'd want
                        to see on the screen.
    warn()        - Use to log a warning message - typically meant for use
                        as non-fatal asserts. These should be rare.

    trace()       - Use to trace method entries/exits.
    
    info, warn, and error also print to the screen, or the screen callback
    function, if it has been set:
    
    setCallback() - Point screen prints to a different handler method.
    
        
    Usage Tips:
        
    Use of this class creates up to 4 logfiles in the specified directory,
    one for debug-level, one for info, one for error (if any) and one for
    warn (if any). Each file in a given log "batch" is prefixed with the
    same 3-digit serial number, for easy grouping/handling. A "batch" occurs
    each time initLogging() is called, and so this should only be called once,
    at the earliest point in program execution.
    
    Logfiles will typically be of the format:
        <serial>.<identifier>.<facility>.log

    For optimum use of this class, pick identifier names that are easily
    identifiable with a discrete operation. For example, use buildID
    (001.80342.info.log) not process name (001.build.info.log).
    Currently, the ribosome system does not readily support this, and logs will
    tend to use either 'build' or 'umake' as an identifier.
    
    Typical example:
        
        Early in program execution, set up the logging system. Any call to
        initLogging() will start a new batch of logging in the specified dir.
            
        import log
        
        log.initLogging( someDir, anIdentifier )
        
 
        Then, in any other place during execution, to log, simply use the
        public hooks:
            
        log.info( msg )
        
        info() can be replaced with debug(), error() or warn() as appropriate.
        
        Usage inside a method will normally look like:
            
        def someMethod( value1, value2 ):
            log.trace( 'entry', [value1, value2] )
            
            <actual method code here>
            
            log.trace( 'exit' , retValue )
            return retValue                       

       
        Messages log as follows:
            
                                      Facility
                          Info  Debug  Error  Warn  Screen
                  INFO     XX    XX                   XX
        LogLevel  DEBUG          XX
                  WARN     XX    XX            XX     XX
                  ERROR    XX    XX     XX            XX
                  
        The logic is:
            Debug logs only to the debug facility.
            Info is for things you would normally log to the screen.
            Error is for execution errors, like missing files, etc.
            Warn is for program errors (code bugs).
            Error and Warn, both log to the screen, so get mirrored to Info,
              but otherwise have their own files for easy spotting.
            *Everything* logs to debug.
          
        Finally, should you want to transfer screen dump over a network pipe
        or otherwise process it, you can use the setCallback() method to
        replace printing to stdout with some other homegrown handler.
        
    ** Run this file on the command line to execute module unit tests. Check 
    log.main.__doc__ for more details.
    
    Future additions:
        Add methods to dynamically adjust log/facility matrix.
        Add pre-init buffering to resolve any chicken/egg issues (such as
           waiting to figure out a directory or identifier name from relevant
           data that might not be known at process bootstrap time).
"""

#
# Issues & Thoughts:
#
# One of the things to keep an eye on is diskspace usage. Since logfiles
# are serialized (and the debug logs can be *quite* large) we may need to
# keep an eye on this.
#
# Another issue is how are we going to log stuff from multiple threads. This
# class is thread-safe, but we might want to implement some kind of thread-id
# recording for any given log message.
