"""This utility is called by UNIX Makefiles to merge a bunch of static
libraries into one library; this makes it so we don't have to have .a's listed
in order, and sometimes multiple times when they have cyclic dependancies
I'm going to regret writing this, but hopefully I'll be gone before
I have to deal with the problems it creates. -Jay.
Heh, I'm definately not going to regret writing this -- somebody else
will!!!"""
