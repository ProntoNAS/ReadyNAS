<h1>Build System Supported Platforms</h1>
<hr>


<p>The build system attempts to auto-detect what platform you are on,
but there are various reasons you may want to force the build system
into building on some other platform.  To do this, you only need to
set the <b>SYSTEM_ID</b> environment variable to the appropriate system
identification string.  I don't have a complete listing here, but most
of the <i>build/umakecf/*.cf</i> files are valid system identifier
strings.</p>


<h3>Windows NT, 2000, XP</h3>
<p><b>Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack &gt;= 3</b>, <b>Windows 2000</b> and
<b>Windows XP</b> are fully supported development platforms.</p>

<h3>Windows 95, 98, ME</h3>
<p>These are unsupported platforms.  However, the build system will run 
under these operating
systems in a degraded mode.  Below are some special instructions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environment size: You'll have to click on the "properties" section
  of your command prompt program, and increase the environment memory
  size to it's maximum.</li>

  <li>Output from sub-programs such as "nmake" will not be captured into
  the build.out file.  Once it's gone in the command-prompt window, it's
  gone forever.</li>

  <li>You'll have to be careful about how large your PATH environment variable
  gets.  It has a rather short maximum size, and you may end up throwing a
  bunch of the build system utility programs into one directory with a 
  short path name to avoid this limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MacOS 8.6, 9.04, 9.1, 9.2</h3>
<p>These versions of MacOS work with the build system, but are not
   recommended.</p>

<h3>MacOS X</h3>
<p>Fully supported.</p>


<h3>Linux, UNIX</h3>
<p>The build system and umake run well under all UNIX/Linux variants.</p>
