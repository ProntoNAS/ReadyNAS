<h1>The buildrc file</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The buildrc file tells the ribosome build system where how to access
CVS and where to look for <a href=bif.html>BIF</a> files. In order to
find your buildrc file, build looks in the following places:
<ol>
<li> $BUILDRC
<li> $HOME/.buildrc
<li> $HOMEDRIVE/$HOMEPATH/.buildrc
<li> "buildrc" in the System Folder:Preferences if you use macpython
</ol>

As you can see there are lots of ways to specify where your buildrc file goes.

</p>

<p>
The buildrc file has the same syntax as a python file, but there are only
two functions available to call:
</p>

<hr>
<a name=AddCVS>
<p>
<b>AddCVS(<i>name, root [, shadow]</i>)</b><br>
<i>arguments: name(string), root(string), shadow(string) </i><br>
<i>returns: none</i><br>

 This function adds a cvs repository and gives it a name.
 If you are using maccvs, then <i>root</i> should be the
 name of a CVSSESSION file, otherwise it should be a standard
 CVSROOT. The <i>name</i> can later be used from a BIF file
 or in a BIF file search path.

<p>
Example: <tt>AddCVS("helix",":pserver:yourname@localhost:/cvs")</tt>
</p>

If the <i>shadow</i> parameter is present, it is assumed to be
a mirror repository which will be used for the initial checkout.
The <tt>CVS/Root</tt> file in each directory will then be updated
to point to the real cvs repository.
</p>
</a>

<hr>
<a name=AddBIFPath>
<p>
<b>AddBIFPath(<i>prefix, path</i>)</b><br>
<i>arguments: prefix(string), path(string)</i><br>
<i>returns: none</i><br>

 This function adds a search path for <a href=bif.html>BIF</a> files.
 The <i>prefix</i> is used to give unique names to targets
 in BIF files, so don't use the same prefix twice.
 Also, the prefix must be a valid file name. The <i>path</i>
 can either be a normal file system path, or a reference to
 a cvs repository. To reference a CVS repository, you must
 use a string like: "[cvsname]/cvsmodule/subdir"
 In this case 'cvsname' is the name of a CVS repository which
 should be added using <a href=#AddCVS>AddCVS</a>.
 <p>
 If no AddBIFPath is present in your buildrc file, or if there
 is no buildrc file, some backwards compatible default will be used.
 <p>
 Example: <tt>AddBIFPath("common","[helix]/common/build/BIF")</tt>
</p>
</a>

<hr>
<a name=AddBIFShadow>
<p>
<b>SetBIFShadow(<i>bif_id</i>)</b><br>
<i>arguments: bif_id(string)</i><br>
<i>returns: none</i><br>

This function instructs the build system to parse the specified BIF
file after reading any other BIF file. This BIF file can thus redefine
modules and modify builds accordingly.

</p>
</a>


<hr>
<a name=AddProfilePath>
<p>
<b>AddProfilePath(<i>prefix, path</i>)</b><br>
<i>arguments: prefix(string), path(string)</i><br>
<i>returns: none</i><br>

 This function adds a search path for <a href=profiles.html>profile</a> files.
 The <i>prefix</i> is used to give unique names to profiles
 in case there are duplicates, so don't use the same prefix twice.
 Also, the prefix must be a valid file name. The <i>path</i>
 can either be a normal file system path, or a reference to
 a cvs repository. To reference a CVS repository, you must
 use a string like: "[cvsname]/cvsmodule/subdir"
 In this case 'cvsname' is the name of a CVS repository which
 should be added using <a href=#AddCVS>AddCVS</a>.
 <p>
 If no AddProfilePath is present in your buildrc file, or if there
 is no buildrc file, some backwards compatible default will be used.
 <p>
 Example: <tt>AddProfilePath("common","[helix]/common/build/umakepf")</tt>
</p>
</a>

<hr>
<a name=SetSDKPath>
<p>
<b>SetSDKPath(<i>sdk_name, path</i>)</b><br>
<i>arguments: sdk_name(string), path(string)</i><br>
<i>returns: none</i><br>

This function tells the build system where to find an SDK.
It is required in order for the build system to be able to
find directx and other third party libraries. These paths
can later be used in your <a href="umakefil.html">Umake files</a>
and should also be declared in your <a href="bif.html">BIF</a>
files.
