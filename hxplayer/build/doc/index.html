<h1>Build System Documentation Index</h1>
<hr>

<p>The Helix Ribosome build system is a set of programs written in the Python
programming language which provide a common interface to retrieving,
and building programs from source code stored in a CVS
repository.  The build system is made up of two basic subsystems.  The
first is the component which calculates the dependencies of a target,
retrieves the source code, and runs commands to build that source code
in the correct order.  This is the program <b>build</b>.  The second
component in the build system is <b>umake</b>, a cross-platform Makefile
generator.  <b>Umake</b> can be used independently from the <b>build</b>
program.</p>
