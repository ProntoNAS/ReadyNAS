DESCRIPTION
        The ribosome build system provides a single interface for
        checking out and building targets in the Helix code
        base on all platforms.

OPTIONS
        --man   Print this information.

        --help  Print this information.

        -a      Create a archive of the entire built tree after the build
                is complete.  This uses the RNA archive format which is
                part of the build system.

        -c      During compiling, run "make clean" to remove targets and
                object files.
                
        -C      Clobber mode. Deletes all modules for the specified target and
                gets fresh code.  (Check in your changes first!)

        -e      Do not run "make depend".

        -l      Do not run "make copy".

        -v      Verbose mode.  Print the output of all commands run by the
                build system to standard output.

        -q      Quiet mode.  Do not print any output to standard output.

        -h      Checkout only.  Fetch all the code and binaries required
                for the build, then exit.

        -k      Do not attempt to check out any files from CVS.

        -n      Does not run UMAKE to re-create the Makefile.  This is
                intended for use on the Macintosh to speed up the build
                process.  On other platforms it is not needed because
                UMAKE takes almost no time to run.

        -o      Do not attempt to compile any modules.

        -u      Update mode.  Run a CVS update on all the modules for the
                specified target before building.

        -y      Yes mode.  Answer 'yes' to all interactive questions normally
                prompted by the build system.

        -m BIF-branch
                Specify the BIF file branch ID of the BIF file the build
                system should use to load its data from.  The default is
                originally set to 'helix', the ID of the head branch.
                Once this is changed by the user in the interactive build
                system, that BIF branch ID is stored in the build system
                preferences and becomes the default.

        -P profile
                Specify which profile to use. You can also specify this
                by setting the PROFILE_ID environment variable. If -P
                is used, it overrides the environment variable.

        -p red|yellow|green
                Set halt priority.  If a module errors while compiling,
                check its .bif halt priority, and halt the build if that
                halt priority is greater than or equal to the selected
                halt priority (ie red > yellow).  This defaults to ignoring
                all errors.

        -d target-dir
                Specify the copy directory for built targets.  This is the
                directory targets are copied to when "make copy" is run.
                The default for this directory is 'debug' when in debug
                mode, and 'release' when in release mode.

        -r cvs-tag
                Checkout and build from the specified CVS tag.

	-D cvs-timestamp
                Checkout and build from the specified CVS timestamp.

        -t build-options
                Pass build options into the build system.  Multiple build
                options can be passed in with multiple -t arguments.

        -s module
                Skip to the specified module and start building from there.

        -j jobs
                Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run
                simultaneously.  The number of jobs should be equal to
                the number of processors you have for maximum effect.
                This option is only supported on UNIX.
