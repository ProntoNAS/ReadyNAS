Known build options. (Use with -t)
</p>

<a name=relase>
<p><b>release</b><br>
Turns on release mode. Normally enables optimizations and
turns of debug information.
</p>
</a>

<a name=archive>
<p><b>archive</b><br>
Creates an archive of the entire build.
</p>
</a>

<a name=no_optimize>
<p><b>no_optimize</b><br>
Turn off optimization.
</p>
</a>

<a name=faacs>
<p><b>faacs</b><br>
????????
</p>
</a>

<a name=map>
<p><b>map</b><br>
Win32
</p>
</a>

<a name=pdb>
<p><b>pdb</b><br>
Put debug information in separate files.
Currently only works on the win32 platforms.
</p>
</a>

<a name=nodll>
<p><b>nodll</b><br>
Don't build dynamic libraries. Build static libraries instead.
</p>
</a>

<a name=nt_stackframe>
<p><b>nt_stackframe</b><br>
?????
</p>
</a>

<a name=symbols>
<p><b>symbols</b><br>
Build with debug information even for a release build.
</p>
</a>

<a name=relsymbl>
<p><b>relsymbl</b><br>
Same as above, obsolete. (I think)
</p>
</a>

<a name=no_c++_runtime>
<p><b>no_c++_runtime</b><br>
For some build, libc++ should not be linked.
This option accomplishes that.
</p>
</a>

<a name=drmsign>
<p><b>drmsign</b><br>
When compiling on the build farm, this will
contact the DRM signing server and sign some
of the binaries generated by this build.
</p>
</a>

<a name=use_exports>
<p><b>use_exports</b><br>
?????????
</p>
</a>

<a name=build-pre-helix>
<p><b>build-pre-helix</b><br>
When this option is selected on the build farm, it
will check out the ribosome build system from the
"pre-helix" branch.
</p>
</a>

<a name=distribute>
<p><b>distribute</b><br>
With this option, the build system will
checkin any distributions generated by this build.
See <a href=bif.html#checkin_dependlist>the checkin_dependlist BIF tag</a>
and the
<a href=umakefil.html#SetDistLocation>SetDistLocation umake function</a>
for further information.
</p>
</a>

<a name=make_distributions>
<p><b>make_distributions</b><br>
This is similar to the "distribute" option, but doesn't actually check
anything in. This will allow you to test the generated libraries before
checking them in by doing:<br>
<br>
Unix realease build: <tt>python $BUILD_ROOT/lib/distributions.py release</tt>.<br>
Win32 debug build: <tt>python %BUILD_ROOT%\lib\distributions.py debug</tt>.<br>
</p>
