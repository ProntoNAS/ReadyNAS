<h1>The umakerc file</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The umakerc file is normally only used for debugging and is parsed
by umake every for every invocation of umake. It is parsed after
everything else and can thus change any setting in any umake file.
Needless to say, this file should be used with caution. In order to
find your umakerc file, umake looks in the following places:
<ol>
<li> $UMAKERC
<li> $HOME/.umakerc
<li> $HOMEDRIVE/$HOMEPATH/.umakerc
<li> "umakerc" in the System Folder:Preferences if you use macpython
</ol>

As you can see there are lots of ways to specify where your umakerc file goes.

</p>

<p>
The umakerc file has the same syntax as a <a href=umakefil.html>umakefil</a>,
but the only function which is really useful is <a href=umakefil.html#AddDebugOutput>project.AddDebugOutput</a>.
