/*
 * Users of the IHXFileFormatObject interface can request
 * meta info from the file format by passing in the
 * string "AcceptMetaInfo" in the request header.
 * This property, if present, is either a delimited
 * list of requested property names or the string "*".
 * If the string is "*", then all available meta info
 * is requested. The delimiter can be either a comma
 * or a semi-colon. All meta info requested (or all
 * available if AcceptMetaInfo = "*") will then be
 * placed in the file header returned asynchronously
 * to the IHXFileFormatObject::GetFileHeader() call.
 *
 * In the function below, an IHXRequest is passed
 * in. If HX_RESULT returns HXR_OK, then the other
 * variables passed in by referenced can then be
 * examined in this order:
 *
 * If "AcceptMetaInfo" is present in the request headers,
 *   then rbAcceptMetaInfoPresent will be TRUE. Otherwise,
 *   it will be FALSE and rbAllMetaInfoRequested and
 *   rpRequestedMetaInfo will not be altered.
 *
 * If rbAcceptMetaInfoPresent is TRUE and
 *   AcceptMetaInfo = "*", then rbAllMetaInfoRequested
 *   will be TRUE and rpRequestedMetaInfo will be NULL.
 *
 * If rbAcceptMetaInfoPresent is TRUE and
 *   AcceptMetaInfo is a delimited string of property
 *   names, then rbAllMetaInfoRequested will be FALSE
 *   and rpRequestedMetaInfo will be non-NULL and will
 *   contain this list of property names as ULONG32
 *   properties. These property names can then be retrieved
 *   by using the IHXValues::GetFirstPropertyULONG32()
 *   and IHXValues::GetNextPropertyULONG32() calls.
 *   Note that this does not imply that the properties
 *   are necessarily ULONG32 properties - it's just
 *   more convenient to make them ULONG32 properties
 *   than CString or Buffer properties.
