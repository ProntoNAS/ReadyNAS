## Description

Enca (Extremely Naive Charset Analyser) consists of two main components:

  * libenca, an encoding detection library.  It currently supports
    Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian,
    Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian, Chinese, and
    some multibyte encodings independently on language.  The API should be
    relatively stable (to be read as `it will either change only
    marginally, or very drastically').

  * enca, a command line frontend, integrating libenca and several
    charset conversion libraries and tools (GNU recode, UNIX98 iconv,
    perl Unicode::Map, cstocs).
