.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Fetches management information from a SCSI Enclosure Service (SES) device.
This utility can also modify the state of a SES device. The \fIDEVICE\fR
should be a SES device which may be a dedicated enclosure services
processor in which case an INQUIRY response's Peripheral Device Type is
13 [0xd]. Alternatively it may be attached to another type of SCSI
device (e.g. a disk) in which case the EncServ bit is set in its INQUIRY
response.
.PP
If no options are given (i.e. only the \fIDEVICE\fR argument is given) then
the names of all diagnostic pages supported are listed. Most, but not
necessarily all, of the named diagnostic pages are defined in the SES
standards and drafts. The most recent reference for this utility is the
draft SCSI Enclosure Services 3 document T10/2149\-D Revision 3 at
http://www.t10.org . Existing standards for SES and SES\-2 are ANSI INCITS
305\-1998 and ANSI INCITS 448\-2008 respectively.
.PP
Changing the state of an enclosure (e.g. requesting the "ident" (locate) LED
to flash on a disk carrier in an array) is typically done using a
read\-modify\-write cycle. See the section on CHANGING STATE below.
.PP
There is a web page discussing this utility at
http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_ses.html .
.PP
In the following sections "page" refers to a diagnostic page, either
fetched with a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command or sent to the
\fIDEVICE\fR with a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
The options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-byte1\fR=\fIB1\fR
some modifiable pages may need byte 1 (i.e. the second byte) set. In the
Enclosure Control page, byte 1 contains the INFO, NON\-CRIT, CRIT and
UNRECOV bits. In the Subenclosure String Out, Subenclosure Nickname Control
and Download Microcode Control pages, byte 1 is the Subenclosure identifier.
Active when the \fI\-\-control\fR and \fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR options are used
and the default value is 0. If the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR or \fI\-\-set=STR\fR
option is used then the value read from byte 1 is written back to byte 1.
\fIB1\fR is in decimal unless it is prefixed by '0x' or '0X' (or has a
trailing 'h' or 'H').
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to clear an element field in the Enclosure Control or Threshold Out
page. Must be used together with a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or
\fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which element is to be changed. The
Enclosure Control page is assumed if the \fI\-\-page=PG\fR option is not
given. See the STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-control\fR
will send control information to the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command. Cannot give both this option and \fI\-\-status\fR.
The Enclosure Control, String Out, Threshold Out, Array Control (obsolete
in SES\-2), Subenclosure String Out, Subenclosure Nickname Control and 
Download Microcode pages can be set currently. This option is assumed if
either the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR or \fI\-\-set=STR\fR option is given.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\fIH,H...\fR
permits a string of comma separated (ASCII) hex bytes to be specified (limit
1024). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed but
the list needs to be in quotes. This option allows the parameters to a
control page to be specified. The string given should not include the first 4
bytes (i.e. page code and length).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\-
reads a data string from stdin, limit 1024 bytes. stdin may provide ASCII
hex as a comma separated list (i.e. as with the \fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR
option).  Additionally spaces, tabs and line feeds are permitted as
separators from stdin . Stops reading stdin when an EOF is detected.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-descriptor\fR=\fIDN\fR
where \fIDN\fR is a descriptor name (string) as found in the Element
Descriptor page. If that page is supported then \fIDN\fR may be an
alternative for \fITIA,II\fR (in the \fI\-\-index=TIA,II\fR option). If the
descriptor name contains a space then \fIDN\fR needs to be surrounded by
quotes (single or double) or the space escaped (e.g. preceded by a backslash).
Some elements (e.g. overall elements) may not have descriptor names. Useful
with the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options.
If no other options are given then the \fI\-\-join\fR option is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-enumerate\fR
enumerate all known page names and SES elements when this option is given
once. If \fI\-\-enumerate\fR is given twice, then the recognised acronyms for
the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options are
listed. The utility exits after listing this information (so most other
options and \fIDEVICE\fR are ignored).
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR
cuts down on the amount of output from the Enclosure Status page and the
Additional Element Status page. When this option is given, any line which
has all its binary flags cleared (i.e. 0) is filtered out (i.e.  ignored).
If a line has some other value on it (e.g. a temperature) then it is output.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-get\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to read a field in a status element. Must be used together with
a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or \fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which
element is to be read. By default the Enclosure Status page is read, the
only other pages that can be read are the Threshold In and Additional
Element Status pages. If a value is found it is output in decimal to
stdout (by default) or in hexadecimal preceded by "0x" if the \fI\-\-hex\fR
option is also given. See the STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
If the \fI\-\-get=STR\fR option is given then output the value found (if
any) in hexadecimal, with a leading "0x". Otherwise output the response
in hexadecimal. Ignored with some options (e.g. \fI\-\-join\fR).
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIIIA\fR
where \fIIIA\fR is either an individual index (II) or an Element type
abbreviation (A). See the INDEXES section below. If the \fI\-\-page=PG\fR
option is not given then the Enclosure Status (or Control) page is assumed.
May be used with the \fI\-\-join\fR option or one of the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR,
\fI\-\-get=STR\fR or \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options. To enumerate the available
Element type abbreviations use the \fI\-\-enumerate\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fITIA,II\fR
where \fITIA,II\fR is an type header index (TI) or Element type
abbreviation (A) followed by an individual index (II). See the INDEXES section
below. If the \fI\-\-page=PG\fR option is not given then the Enclosure
Status (or Control) page is assumed. May be used with the \fI\-\-join\fR
option or one of the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR or
\fI\-\-set=STR\fR options. To enumerate the available Element type
abbreviations use the \fI\-\-enumerate\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inner\-hex\fR
the outer levels of a status page are decoded and printed out but the
innermost level (e.g. the Element Status Descriptor) is output in hex. Also
active with the Additional Element Status and Threshold In pages. Can be
used with \fI\-\-index=...\fR and/or \fI\-\-join\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-join\fR
group elements from the Element Descriptor, Enclosure Status and Additional
Element Status pages. If this option is given twice then elements from the
Threshold In page are also grouped. The order is dictated by the Configuration
page. All elements are output unless the \fI\-\-index=\fR or
\fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR option is given, in which case only the matching
element is output. See the INDEXES section below.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
This option is equivalent to \fI\-\-enumerate\fR. See that option.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-page\fR=\fIPG\fR
where \fIPG\fR is a page abbreviation or code (a number). If \fIPG\fR
starts with a digit it is assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed by
0x for hex. Valid range is 0 to 255 (0x0 to 0xff) inclusive. Default is
page 'sdp' which is page_code 0 (i.e. "Supported Diagnostic Pages") if
no other options are given.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
outputs the chosen status page in ASCII hex in a format suitable for a
later invocation using the \fI\-\-data=\fR option. A page less its first
4 bytes (page code and length) is output. When used twice (e.g. \fI\-rr\fR)
the full page contents is output in binary to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-set\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to set an element field in the Enclosure Control or Threshold Out
page. Must be used together with a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or
\fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which element is to be changed. The
Enclosure Control page is assumed if the \fI\-\-page=PG\fR option is not
given. See the STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
will fetch page from the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
command. In the absence of other options that imply modifying a page (e.g.
\fI\-\-control\fR or \fI\-\-set=STR\fR) then \fI\-\-status\fR is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH INDEXES
An enclosure can have information about its disk and tape drives plus other
supporting components like power supplies spread across several pages.
Addressing a specific element (overall or individual) is complicated.
.PP
The Configuration page is key: it contains a list of "type headers", each
of which contains an Element type (e.g. Array Device Slot), a Subenclosure
identifier (0 for the primary enclosure) and a "Number of possible elements".
Corresponding to each type header, the Enclosure Status page has one "overall"
element plus "Number of possible elements" individual elements all of which
have the given Element type. For some Element types the "Number of possible
elements" will be 0 so the Enclosure Status page has only one "overall"
element corresponding to that type header. The Element Descriptor page and
the Threshold (In and Out) pages follow the same pattern as the Enclosure
Status page.
.PP
The Additional Element Status page is a bit more complicated. It has
entries for "Number of possible elements" of certain Element types. It
does not have entries corresponding to the "overall" elements. To make
the correspondence a little clearer each descriptor in this page optionally
contains an "Element Index Present" (EIP) indicator. If EIP is set then each
element's "Element Index" field refers to the position of the corresponding
element in the Enclosure Status page.
.PP
Addressing a single overall element or a single individual element is done
with two indexes: TI and II. Both are origin 0. TI=0 corresponds to the
first type header entry which must be a Device Slot or Array Device Slot
Element type (according to the SES\-2 standard). To address the corresponding
overall instance, II is set to \-1, otherwise II can be set to the individual
instance index. As an alternative to the type header index (TI), an Element
type abbreviation (A) optionally followed by a number (e.g. "ps" refers to
the first Power Supply Element type; "ps1" refers to the second) can be
given.
.PP
One of two command lines variants can be used to specify indexes:
\fI\-\-index=TIA,II\fR where \fITIA\fR is either an type header index (TI)
or an Element type abbreviation (A) (e.g. "ps" or "ps1"). \fIII\fR is
is either an individual index or "\-1" to specify the overall element. The
second variant is \fI\-\-index=IIA\fR where \fIIIA\fR is either an individual
index (II) or an Element type abbreviation (A). When \fIIIA\fR is an
individual index then the option is equivalent to \fI\-\-index=0,II\fR. When
\fIIIA\fR is an Element type abbreviation then the option is equivalent to
\fI\-\-index=A,\-1\fR.
.PP
To cope with vendor specific Element types (which should be in the range 128
to 255) the Element type can be given as a number with a leading underscore.
For example these are equivalent: \fI\-\-index=arr\fR and
\fI\-\-index=_23\fR since the Array Device Slot Element type value is 23.
Also \fI\-\-index=ps1\fR and \fI\-\-index=_2_1\fR are equivalent.
.PP
Another example: if the first type header in the Configuration page has Array
Device Slot Element type then \fI\-\-index=0,\-1\fR is equivalent to
\fI\-\-index=arr\fR. Also \fI\-\-index=arr,3\fR is equivalent to
\fI\-\-index=3\fR.
.PP
Note that if the Element Descriptor page is available then the 
\fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR option may be an alternative to the
\fI\-\-index=...\fR option.
.SH STR FORMAT
The \fISTR\fR operands of the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and
\fI\-\-set=STR\fR options all have the same structure. There are two forms:
.br
      <acronym>[=<value>]
.br
      <start_byte>:<start_bit>[:<num_bits>][=<value>]
.PP
The <acronym> is one of a list of common fields (e.g. "ident" and "fault")
that the utility converts internally into the second form. The <start_byte>
is usually in the range 0 to 3, the <start_bit> must be in the range 0 to
7 and the <num_bits> must be in the range 1 to 64 (default 1). The
number of bits are read in the left to right sense of the element tables
shown in the various SES draft documents. For example the 8 bits of
byte 2 would be represented as 2:7:8 with the most significant bit being
2:7 and the least sugnificant bit being 2:0 .
.PP
The <value> is optional but is ignored if provided to \fI\-\-get=STR\fR.
For \fI\-\-set=STR\fR the default <value> is 1 while for \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR
the default value is 0 .
.PP
The supported list of <acronym>s can be viewed by using the
\fI\-\-enumerate\fR option twice (or "\-ee").
.SH CHANGING STATE
This utility has various techniques for changing the state of a SES device.
As noted above this is typically a read\-modify\-write type operation.
Most modifiable pages have a "status" (or "in") page that can be read, and
a corresponding "control" (or "out") page that can be written back to change
the state of the enclosure.
.PP
The lower level technique provided by this utility involves outputting
a "status" page in hex with \fI\-\-raw\fR. Then a text editor can be used
to edit the hex (note: to change an Enclosure Control descriptor the SELECT
bit needs to be set). Next the control page data can fed back with the
\fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR option together with the \fI\-\-control\fR option;
the \fI\-\-byte1=B1\fR option may need to be given as well.
.PP
Changes to the Enclosure Control page (and the Threshold Out page) can be
done at a higher level. This involves choosing a page (the default in this
case is the Enclosure Control page). Next choose an individual or overall
element index (or name it with its Element Descriptor string). Then give
the element's name (e.g. "ident" for RQST IDENT) or its position within that
element (e.g. in an Array Device Slot Control element RQST IDENT is byte 2,
bit 1 and 1 bit long ("2:1:1")). Finally a value can be given, if not the
value for \fI\-\-set=STR\fR defaults to 1 and for \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR
defaults to 0.
.SH NOTES
This utility can be used to fetch arbitrary (i.e. non SES) diagnostic
pages (using the SCSI READ DIAGNOSTIC command). To this end the
\fI\-\-page=PG\fR and \fI\-\-hex\fR options would be appropriate. Arbitrary
diagnostic pages can be sent to a device with the sg_senddiag utility.
.PP
The most troublesome part of the join operation is associating Additional
Element Status descriptors correctly. At least one SES device vendor has
misinterpreted the SES\-2 standard with its "element index" field. The
code in this utility interprets the "element index" field per the SES\-2
standard and if that yields an inappropriate Element type, adjusts its
indexing to follow that vendor's misinterpretation. 
.PP
There is a related command set called SAF\-TE (SCSI attached fault\-tolerant
enclosure) for enclosure (including RAID) status and control. SCSI devices
that support SAF\-TE report "Processor" peripheral device type (0x3) in their
INQUIRY response. See the sg_safte utility in this package or safte\-monitor
on the Internet.
.SH EXAMPLES
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in
other supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
.PP
To view the supported pages:
.PP
   sg_ses /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0
.PP
To view the Configuration page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=cf /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0
.PP
To view the Enclosure Status page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=es /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0
.PP
To get the (attached) SAS address of that device (which is held in the
Additional Element Sense page (page 10)) printed on hex:
.PP
   sg_ses \-p aes \-D ArrayDevice07 \-G at_sas_addr \-H /dev/sg3
.PP
To collate the information in the Enclosure Status, Element Descriptor
and Additional Element Status pages the \fI\-\-join\fR option can be used:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-join /dev/sg3
.PP
This will produce a lot of output. To filter out lines that don't contain
much information add the \fI\-\-filter\fR option:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-join \-\-filter /dev/sg3
.PP
Fields in the various elements of the Enclosure Control and Threshold pages
can be changed with the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR
options. [All modifiable pages can be changed with the \fI\-\-raw\fR and
\fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR options.] The following example looks at making
the "ident" LED (also called "locate") flash on "ArrayDevice07" which is a
disk (or more precisely the carrier drawer the disk is in):
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-index=7 \-\-set=2:1:1 /dev/sg3
.PP
If the Element Descriptor diagnostic page shows that "ArrayDevice07" is
the descriptor name associated with element index 7 then this invocation
is equivalent to the previous one:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-set=2:1:1 /dev/sg3
.PP
Further the byte 2, bit 1 (for 1 bit) field in the Array Device Slot Control
element is RQST IDENT for asking a disk carrier to flash a LED so it can
be located. In this case "ident" (or "locate") is accepted as an acronym
for that field:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-set=ident /dev/sg3
.PP
To stop that LED flashing:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-clear=ident /dev/sg3
.PP
Now for an example of a more general but lower level technique for changing
a modifiable diagnostic page. The String (In and Out) diagnostics page is
relatively simple (compared with the Enclosure Status/Control page). However
the use of this lower level technique is awkward involving three steps: read,
modify then write. First check the current String (In) page contents:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=str /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0
.PP
Now the "read" step. The following command will send the contents of the
String page (from byte 4 onwards) to stdout. The output will be in ASCII
hex with pairs of hex digits representing a byte, 16 pairs per line,
space separated. The redirection puts stdout in a file called "t":
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=str \-\-raw /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0 > t
.PP
Then with the aid of the SES\-3 document (in revision 3: section 6.1.6)
use your favourite editor to change t. The changes can be sent to the
device with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=str \-\-control \-\-data=\- /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0 < t
.PP
If the above is successful, the String page should have been changed. To
check try:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=str /dev/bsg/6:0:2:0
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_ses is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
