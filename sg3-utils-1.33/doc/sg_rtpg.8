[\fI\-\-decode\fR] [\fI\-\-help\fR] [\fI\-\-hex\fR] [\fI\-\-raw\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send a SCSI REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS command to \fIDEVICE\fR and
outputs the response.
.PP
Target port group access is described in SPC\-3 found at www.t10.org
in section 5.8 (in rev 21c dated 2005/1/15). The Report Target Port
Groups command is also described in that document.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-decode\fR
decodes the status code and asymmetric access state from each
target port group descriptor returned. The default action is not
to decode these values.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output response in hex (rather than partially or fully decode it).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output response in binary to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
The Report Target Port Groups command should be supported whenever the TPGS
bits in a standard INQUIRY response are greater than zero. [View with
sg_inq utility.]
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_rtpg is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
