Description: helper tools for all init systems
 This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between
 the various init systems that Debian contains (e.g. sysvinit, upstart,
 systemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit
 files without depending on a running systemd.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

Description: debhelper add-on to handle systemd unit files
 dh-systemd provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'systemd' and the
 dh_systemd_enable/dh_systemd_start commands.
 .
 The dh_systemd_enable command adds the appropriate code to the postinst, prerm
 and postrm maint scripts to properly enable/disable systemd service files.
 The dh_systemd_start command deals with start/stop/restart on upgrades for
 systemd-only service files.

 ensuring that one of these is available on the system at all times.
