Using libgphoto2 as a normal user
---------------------------------

This version of libgphoto2-installs hotplug and udev files in
/etc/hotplug/usb/libgphoto2 (resp /etc/udev/libgphoto2.rules) to
allow camera access to all members of group 'plugdev'.

This means the only configuration is to add authorized users to the
'plugdev' group.  Note that group changes will only apply when you
relog.

Currently udev can only set group ownership on specific USB ID, not
on a general capability such as "PTP camera".  If you know your camera
is compatible with PTP and is not handled by udev, you can create a file
in /etc/udev/rules.d/, say z25_my_camera.rules, with such a content:

ACTION=="add", SYSFS{idVendor}=="XXXX", SYSFS{idProduct}=="YYYY", \
  MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"

You can get XXXX and YYYY value with lsusb, for example:

  Bus 001 Device 010: ID 04a9:3125 Canon, Inc.
                         ^^^^ ^^^^
			 XXXX YYYY

You can also send the USB ID as a Debian bug report or to gphoto2
development mailing list at gphoto-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Note: before 2.2.1-9, the group was not 'plugdev' but 'camera'.
