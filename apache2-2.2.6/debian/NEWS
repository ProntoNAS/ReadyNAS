apache2 (2.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version introduces some changes in the configuration layout and
    defaults. You will probably have to adjust your configuration accordingly.

    - Module specific configuration has been moved from 
      /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to /etc/apache2/mods-available/*.conf for the
      following modules: 
        actions          alias              autoindex
        info             mime               negotiation
        setenvif         status

    - AddDefaultCharset is again disabled by default. See
      /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset

    - "Listen 443" is automatically enabled in /etc/apache2/ports.conf if
      mod_ssl is enabled.

  * The NO_START functionality from /etc/default/apache2 has been removed. If
    you don't want to start apache2 on boot, rename the S*apache2 start
    symlinks as usual.

  * Disk caching is now enabled by default if mod_disk_cache is enabled. If
    you don't want to use disk caching, check that mod_disk_cache is disabled
    (it was enabled automatically by previous versions when mod_proxy was
    enabled). In this case, you might also want to remove any cache files from
    /var/cache/apache2/mod_disk_cache .

    To ensure that the disk cache does not grow indefinitely, htcacheclean is
    now started when mod_disk_cache is enabled. The details can be configured
    in /etc/default/apache2 .
