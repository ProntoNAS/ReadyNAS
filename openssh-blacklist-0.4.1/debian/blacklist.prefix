# After these initial comments, all the lines in this file must be
# exactly the same length, and must be in sorted order. Each line must
# consist of the lower-case key fingerprint (ssh-keygen -l -f
# /path/to/key), without colons, and with the first 12 characters
# removed (that is, the lower 80 bits of the fingerprint). Unless these
# rules are followed, the blacklist will not work properly. See
# ssh-vulnkey(1).
