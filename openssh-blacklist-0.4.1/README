The blacklists are separate by architecture, type, and bit size.  The
contents are ordered by process pid, starting at PID 1 and ending at PID
32767.

While generating entries, each possible process ID must be used.  To
help automate this, LD_PRELOAD is used to override the getpid() libc
function.  See "generate-blacklist.sh" for details.  Note that the list
is architecture-specific.
