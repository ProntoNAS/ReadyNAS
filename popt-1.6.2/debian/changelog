popt (1.6.2-7) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Please consider for inclusion in woody.

popt (1.6.2-6) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Modified depends in libpopt-dev to depend on
    libpopt0 (= ${Source-Version}). Previous uploads would allow 
    libpopt0 to get out of step with libpopt-dev, causing compiles to
    fail if the user starts from having 1.5-1 installed, and only 
    upgrades libpopt0. This is a violation of a "should" policy 
    directive.  (Closes: #125685)
  * Removed redundant ldconfig call from debian/libpopt0.postinst, as
    debhelper does it for us. Fixes lintian postinst-unsafe-ldconfig
    warning.
  * Uploading with urgency=high, since this upload contains 
    only minimal, "important" bugfixes.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 12:31:24 +0100

popt (1.6.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update config.guess and config.sub to the latest from GNU, to allow

popt (1.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added versioned conflict to rpm which is statically built, as
    that also includes all the .po files from popt.
    (Closes: #95026,#95029)
  * Changed libpopt0's section from libs to base, so that it agrees with
    the override on ftp.debian.org.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Apr 2001 17:21:26 +0100

popt (1.4-1.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Move libpopt to /lib since pump (/sbin) uses it. (Closes: Bug#62314)
  * Add conflicts for libpopt-dev (old versions of -dev point to /usr/lib,
    which makes ldconfig complain)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Apr 2000 14:55:29 +1000

popt (1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed popt.ps from the "upstream" tarball (which I make from the
    rpm anyway) and the package---it's non-free! (Closes: #41578)

    Troan says contains everything the postscript doc does

popt (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Whee, split libpopt0 and libpopt-dev packages
  * Standards-version 3.0.0
  * Since I had to rewrite the rules file, it now uses debhelper v2

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 06:11:11 -0700

popt (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependencies

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Mon, 24 May 1999 01:31:16 -0700

popt (1.3-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer Upload
  * New upstream version
  * Changes required due to the new upstream in excruciatingly exact detail
    since this is a NMU:
    - make PREFIX= is now make DESTDIR=
    - clean target now uses make distclean, not make squeaky
    - popt.3 manpage gets compressed
    - /usr/lib/libpopt.la is chmod'd 644 to kill lintian warning
    - libpopt.so is now --strip-unneeded'd and chmod'd 644
    - added postinst file and made it call ldconfig on configure
    - added shlibs file

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Apr 1999 14:22:11 -0700
