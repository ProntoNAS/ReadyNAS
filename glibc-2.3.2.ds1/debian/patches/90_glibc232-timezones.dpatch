-# From Ephraim Silverberg (2002-07-07):
-#
-# The Israeli government today adopted a proposal by Minister of Interior
-# Eli Yishai to shorten the period of Daylight Savings Time for the year
-# 2002 (only -- the dates for 2003 and 2004 are, so far, unaffected).
-#
-# The proposed date to Daylight Savings Time is September 13, 2002 instead
-# of the current date: October 7, 2002.  The hour of changeover has not
-# yet been decided.
-#
-# (2002-07-10):
-# While today the Knesset passed the initial proposal to reduce DST by
-# some three weeks, a new compromise is being worked out between
-# Minister of Justice Meir Sheetrit and Minister of Interior Eli
-# Yishai to revert to standard time for a period of 48-96 _hours_
-# (sic) around the Yom Kippur fast day (September 15-16) and then go
-# *back* to DST until the end of October.  The details of the proposal
-# have yet to be worked out, but the second and final readings of the
-# bill have until July 24 to pass.
-#
-# (2002-07-25):
-# Thanks go to Yitschak Goldberg from E&M for bringing this (Hebrew) article
-# to my attention:
-#
-#	http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2019315,00.html
-#
-# Hence, the proposal to shorten DST was withdrawn yesterday and the timezone
-# files that have been in effect since July 2000 are still valid for all of
-# 2002.
-#
-# Please note that the article mentions that the Shas MK's intend to
-# bring up their amendment for future years (2003 and beyond).  What this
-# means exactly is anyone's guess since there are no set dates yet beyond
-# 2004 and the end day set for 2003 and 2004 is already the 7th of Tishrei
-# (i.e. before the fast of Yom Kippur).  The only thing they may want to
-# change is the start date of DST in 2003 from Mar.28.03 (24th of Adar II)
-# to Apr.18.03 (16th of Nisan) so that the Passover Seder will take place
-# during Standard Time.  The start date for 2004 is already Nisan 16th.

+# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting

+# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's

+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

 # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
 # that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
 # So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.

-# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.

-# Pam Belluck reported in the New York Times (2001-01-31) that the
-# Indiana Legislature is considering a bill to adopt DST statewide.
-# Her article mentioned Vevay, whose post office observes a different
-# time zone from Danner's Hardware across the street.
+# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-16):
+# http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html says that Indiana will use DST starting 2006.

+# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
+# this rule is 2:OO a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
+# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
+# Strictly speaking, this means the affected counties will change their

 # Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
 # Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
 # Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
 # Far west Ontario is like Winnipeg; far east Quebec is like Halifax.

+# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
+# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
+# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
+# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
+# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
+# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
+# only two weeks -- I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
+# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
+# earlier in June).

+# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
+# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
+#
+#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
+#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and

+# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
+# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
+# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
+# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current

+
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
+# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
+# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
+# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
+# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
+# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
+# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move

 # Haiti
+# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
+# Risto O. Nykanen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
+# I searched for confirmation, and I found a
+# <a href="http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc"> press release
+# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
+# </a>.  Translated from French, it says:
+#
+#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
+#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
+#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
+#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
+#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
+#
+#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
+#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour
+#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
+#   October 2005.
+#
+#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
+#
+# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
+# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
+# last year, so the current "only" rule for 2005 might be changed to a
+# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
+# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
+#
+# I have found this article about it (in French):
+# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
+#
+# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.

+# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/27/de_604825.asp
+# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/28/de_605203.asp

+# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
+# midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
+# Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
+# time in October 17th.
+#
+# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
+# Tierra del Fuego, Tucuman.
+#
+# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
+# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucuman decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00
+# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's
+# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....
+#
+# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
+# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
+#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
+#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
+#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
+#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
+# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
+# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
+# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
+# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
+# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
+# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
+#
+# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
+# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone
+# back in May have been modified slightly in a new law 7277, which set the
+# new end date to 2004-09-26 (original date was 2004-10-17).
