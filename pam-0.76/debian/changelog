pam (0.72-11) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all traces of pwdb in packages. libpwdb has been removed from
    the archive. This means that the pam_pwdb and pam_radius modules are
    no longer available (from the libpam-pwdb package).
  * doc/modules/pam_wheel.sgml: Really spell out that being a member of a
    group meands the user is listed in /etc/group, closes: #69242
  * doc/*: s/PAM_AUTHOK_RECOVERY_ERR/PAM_AUTHOK_RECOVER_ERR/g,
    closes: #64473
  * pam_wheel: PAM does not distinguish it, the libc calls make the
    distinction. The users gid is returned in their passwd info, while
    getgrent() returns only the members of the group listed in /etc/group.
    This is ok, because if it's really that important, you can actually
    have it in both places. The fact that it's documented should suffice
    in making this clear, closes: #69236
  * Sorry, but seperate modules generally need to be packaged seperately.
    I don't want to overload this package with everyone's pet module, so I
    have to put my foot down, closes: #61759
  * Actually, I'm going to move in Woody to make packages depend more on
    the defaults in /etc/pam.d/other, so that admins have less to
    maintain. For one, all packages should not have a password service
    listed, closes: #70000 (YAY! I got the 70k rollover bug number!)
  * Sorry, I can't include this. "," is a legitimate char in a password
    salt/hash. If you can code up something that is super intelligent
    about lenghts of the field, I can go for it, maybe, closes: #59459
  * modules/pam_limits: Added chroot feature patch, closes: #61090
  * modules/pam_access: Allow last field to contain ':', closes: #67291
  * modules/pam_limits: Allow explicit limits for root, closes: #62448
  * modules/pam_unix: Do not zero old/new password fields, libpam does
    this itself, and doing so in the module breaks stacking,
    closes: #66270
  * modules/pam_group: Allow alpha *and* numeric in tty field (duh),
    closes: #63752
  * modules/pam_access: Enable NIS, closes: #64854
  * libpam0g-dbg: removed, useless anyway

    unknown users for auth attempts, closes: #61942
  * Fixed ttyname() parsing in pam_access to match that of the old shadow
    access.conf s,/dev/,, closes: #61644
  * Set some sane defaults for pam_limits.so instead of carrying over
    potentially bad defaults, patch from Peter Paluch
    <peterp@frcatel.fri.utc.sk> closes: #63230
  * Allow explicit (e.g. specified specifically for) limits for root,
    patch from Topi Miettinen <Topi.Miettinen@nic.fi>, closes: #62448

pam (0.72-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Well, this is an odd one. A recompile fixes it. So it must have been a
    problem from linking with 0.71 when this is version 0.72. All of this
    build daemons seem to have compiled the latest 0.72, so this should be
    resolved after this gets recompiled on all of them, closes: #51619, #49584
  * This is from a very old version (0.56) of libpam0. It is not relevant
    to the latest version, closes: #47162

  * New upstream release, merges lots of patches from the Debian source,
    also merges the pam_{motd,mkhomedir,issue} modules into the main
    source. Lots of minor bugs fixed, and compiler warnings
  * pam_mail: Reimplemented the authentication handlers, so now this works
    as both (changes nothing in Debian, but was required to get the patch
    accepted upstream)
  * general: Lots of small edits to fix compiler warnings
  * pam_userdb: fixed potential usage of an unitialized value as
    PAM_AUTHTOK, doesn't look particularly exploitable, but better safe

    closes: #45670
  * with the new pam_unix module, this bug is fixed, closes: #42230
  * pam_limits.c: make sure that we not only ignore limits on root, we
    also remove them just in case we are su'ing from a limited user to
    the root account (since as root they can remove the limits anyway),
    closes: #35302

pam (0.69-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: fixed module_check
  * pam_env/pam_env.c: fixed env parsing to include values wrapped in ''
    and also allow continued lines with a trailing '\'.
  * pam_motd,pam_mail: converted to session modules, so that they could
    be ordered with the lastlog module
  * updated default pam.d/login to reflect above change (now login looks
    the same as the non-PAM version, lastlog, then motd, and then mail
    check)
  * pam_motd: removed extraneous \n from output
  * modules/pam_limits/pam_limits.c: Fixed parsing of lines with only
    "domain -", which was documented as being able to get rid of limits
    for that user or group.
  * debian/control: (libpam-cracklib) Added depends for cracklib-runtime,

    patch left over from the source upgrade...removed all but the pwdb
    purging, closes: #45088
  * modules/pam_env/pam_env.c: Changed to a debug message, instead of a
    syslog message when /etc/environment does not exist.

pam (0.69-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed libpam0g's preinst check for full paths in the pam.d files,
    this should really be a lintian check at build (i think the old libpam
    could not work like this, but hey...things change for the better some
    times. This PAM works fine like that). closes: #45001
   +NOTE: Debian packages should not reference modules by the full path
    so they don't break if I ever decide to move the modules to a different
    default directory. Only the admin should reference full paths and only
    for locally installed modules. I have submitted a request to check for
    this in lintian along with a few other devious things.
  * debian/patches/008_pam_mkhomedir: Fix title of sgml doc

pam (0.69-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/modules/pam_cracklib.sgml: changed to correct path for
    cracklib_dict reference.
  * modules/pam_env/pam_env.c: now groks bash style env's from
    /etc/environment to be compatible with other programs that use it.
  * modules/pam_securetty/pam_securetty.c: don't just plain fail when
    root isn't allowed to login, fake a password request just like any
    good auth module would. Keeps us from letting them know that they
    are doing something bad :)
  * modules/pam_{motd,mkhomedir}: merged these two modules into this
    source, also wrote corresponding sgml files for libpam-doc,
    closes: #40754
  * debian/control: Moved libpam0g, libpam-modules and libpam-runtime
    to base with required priority since login depends on them and
    policy will require this

pam (0.69-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified build so that it uses libs and headers in the build tree
    rather than on the local system. This involved changint the build
    order slightly and should make it easier to compile on new archs.
  * Modified pam_limits so that it was invoked during pam_sm_setcred()
    instead of during pam_sm_session_open() so that it will work with
    shadow's su.
  * Fixed missing symbols in libpam.so, they were caused by it thinking
    it was supposed to have static modules built in.
  * Fixed problem where libpam was getting built with -DDEBUG
  * pam_unix_passwd.c: Changed the perms on shadow to be 0.42 and 0640
    instead of 0.0 and 0600
  * unix_chkpwd: fix it not being sgid shadow

  * Moved to FHS compliance (including use of debhelper 2.0.40),
    this also raises the policy version to 3.0.1.1
  * Don't check the paths in /etc/pam.d files anymore. This is old
    and causes nothing but complaints, closes: #39747
  * Build libpam0g-dbg with debuggable static and shared libraries, also
    enabled the internal DEBUG_REL compile flag for these so that the
    debugging messages will also be output

  * Merged pam_unix_*.so modules into one pam_unix.so with symlinks
    for backward compatibility. This helps centralize this module the
    same way the pam_pwdb.so is and the way pam_unix.so is on other
    operating systems (commercial ones specifically).

    needs read permissions to /etc/shadow and not write.
  * Moved a lot of files arouns to get rid of libpam-runtime dependencies
  * Put libpam-pwdb into it's own package
  * Removed -lpwdb links for modules since libpwdb is somewhat buggy (or
    alteast it's interaction with libpam is)
  * Fixed bug in pam_unix_passwd.so that caused it to never authenticate
    the correct passwd, making it so you couldn't change the passwd

  * Harcoded modules directory prefixed with the .so version, and
    used alternatives to create the symlink to the 'default' modules
    directory. libpam will use the full path when specified, but use the
    versioned modules directory for relative names.
  * Put libpam0g-cracklib modules back in (own package). This means that
    cracklib support is _not_ in the static libpam.a, also cracklib
    support is _not_ in pam_unix_passwd.o, but only in pam_cracklib.so
    by itself.
  * Fixed a few typos in the source causing compile errors
  * Fixed source #include's so that pam _didn't_ have to be installed
    in order to compile the source ( changed from <> to "" )
  * Removed empty directories from built packages
  * Opted not to build examples, only going to put *.c files in examples
    directory for libpam0g-dev
  * Moved *.sgml files for modules into their own directory (looks like
    that is what the original maintainer wanted to do, but it didn't go)
  * Moved doc build to arch-indep build in rules so that it doesn't get
    built when specifying -B with debuild/dpkg-buildpackage.
  * Moved `touch .quiet...' to build-stamp in order to have -B builds not
    ask about pam.conf
  * Split out non-standard modules to their own package, so as to make the
    base install smaller (planning for base inclusion here)
  * Created small manpage for pwdb_chkpwd. closes: #10941
  * The Copright file in /usr/doc/*/ was already named copright and not
    compressed. closes: #14533
  * Package is now lintian clean. closes #19383, #5132
  * There is a maintainer now and the patch for #25915 is still included
    so.... closes: #25915
  * Added check for editor backup files in /etc/pam.d (*~). closes: #28075
  * Applied patch for md5.h in pam_pwdb module. closes: #31548
  * Added support for dhelp in libpam-doc. closes: #31191

pam (0.65-0.8) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Marked PAM as orphaned, given that there has been no maintainer upload
    in almost two years.
  * [defs/debian.defs] Removed superflous cracklib2 dependency.
    (Urgent as cracklib still has release-critical bugs).
    (Fixes #30862).

pam (0.65-0.7) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed security vulnerability in the pam_unix and pam_tally modules
    (reported by Michal Zalewski on bugtraq; patch 
    A000-SECURITY-PATCH-0.65-and-below.gz by Andrey V. Savochkin).

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Tue, 29 Dec 1998 16:20:18 +0100

pam (0.65-0.6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed distribution of files over the various packages, which was
    severely messed up.
  * Added appropriate Replaces: to ensure upgrading from both the hamm
    version and previous slink versions.
  * Fixed debug libraries, PAM module loading.
  * Added examples.
  * Added a "pam-undocumented" manpage pointing to libpam-doc, and
    made links for functions without a manpage to that.

pam (0.65-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewritten the preinst warning text (it still mentioned the search path).

pam (0.65-0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * It looks like I misunderstood DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH: Linux-PAM does not
    currently seem to be easily configured to look for modules in more than
    one directory. With this version, it's configured to look only in
    /lib/security .

pam (0.65-0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Moving the PAM modules to /lib/security broke netatalk.
    Added a preinst script to detect /etc/pam.d files with explicit paths to
    PAM modules, give a warning about them, and offer to abort the install
    (Fixes #27514).

pam (0.65-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Argh. The tools didn't recognise -0.1 as a new upstream release, so
    my previous upload was rejected due to a missing .orig.tar.gz .

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Sun,  4 Oct 1998 17:15:09 +0200

pam (0.65-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Major package overhaul; now uses debhelper.
  * In experimental for now. *Please* provide feedback; if the feedback is
    positive, we can put this in slink.
  * Dropped libc5 support.
  * [libpam/pam_static.c] Fixed compilation: "pamh" was undefined; use "NULL".
    is this the correct fix?
  * [defs/debian.defs] New.
  * [Makefile]
    * Exit when a make in a subdirectory fails.
    * Compile statically too.
    * New variables: LC, LP, LPLIBS, DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH .
  * [libpam/Makefile]
    * Use DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH if nonempty.
    * Link libpam against LPLIBS.
  * [modules/*/Makefile]
    * Link the dynamic security objects against libpam and libc
     (LP and LC).
  * [modules/pam_pwdb/Makefile]
    * Link dynamic security objects against libcrypt and libnsl.
  * [conf/install_conf] Allow for non-interactive install (as the other
    install_conf scripts already did).
  * Automatically determine the list of /etc/security/* conffiles.
  * Moved libpam to /lib, and PAM modules to /lib/security as they will
    become part of the base system in the future.
  * Built without cracklib support, to keep the base system smaller.
  * /sbin/pwdb_chkpwd is undocumented, as is upperLOWER.

pam (0.57b-0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non maintainer upload
    My previous upload had removed the libc5 stuff from the controlfile
    messing up things. Change 'Architecture: any' to 'i386 m68k' for those
    .deb's instead.

 -- Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Aug 1998 20:06:50 -0400

pam (0.57b-0.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non maintainer upload
    On a glibc2.1 system, XCASE is only defined in the <bits/termios.h>
    _IF_ '__USE_MISC' or '__USE_UNIX98' is defined.

 -- Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Aug 1998 22:13:45 -0400

pam (0.57b-0.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Yet another non-maintainer release.
  * Zero changes; simply a re-upload due to a rm-trigger happy release
    ``manager''.

 -- James Troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>  Tue, 17 Mar 1998 19:55:16 +0100

pam (0.57b-0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Updated to 2.4.0.0.
  * debian/control (libpam0g-dev): Also conflict with libpam-dbg.
  * debian/postinst: use case statement instead of if.
  * debian/rules (COMPAT_ARCHES): removed sparc.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc6-dev, binary-libc5-altdev): strip static libraries with
    --strip-debug, not --strip-unneeded.
  * debian/rules: each package now has it's own doc directory under
    /usr/doc/, containing at least the copyright file (Policy 5.6).
  * debian/rules: install files with `install -m 644' not `cp -p' to avoid
    read-only files.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc6-util): strip /usr/lib/*/security/*.so with
    --strip-unneeded.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc5-util): ditto.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc5): don't depend on binary-libc5.

pam (0.57b-0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * New upstream version.
  * Doesn't use pristine upstream source as the upstream tar ball is broken.
  * Added libc6 libraries libpam0g, libpam0g-dev, libpam0g-dbg and
    libpam0g-util. [#11697]
  * libpam-dev becomes libpam0-altdev, libpam-util -> libpam0-altutil and
    libpam-dbg is removed.
  * libpam0 depends on libpam0g because libpam0g contains the pam conffile.
  * libpam0-util depends on libpam0g-util because libpam0g contains the binary.
  * Compiled with -D_REENTRANT and link with -lc.
  * Fixed permissions on shared libraries.
  * Corrected syntax of /etc/pam.d/other. [#10497, #10758, #12030]
  * Fixed typos in postinst. [#10474, #11365]
  * Made /etc/pam.conf a conffile.
  * Updated URL in copyright file.

pam (0.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Converted to new packaging format.

pam (0.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files.
  * changes to the installation procedure to fit the Debian packaging
    system ($PREFIX handling, unconditionally install configuration files,
    don't run ldconfig after installing the shared libraries).
  * added documentation in the extradoc directory
  * commented out all unused entries in etc/pam.conf, etc/secure/group.conf
    and etc/secure/time.conf
