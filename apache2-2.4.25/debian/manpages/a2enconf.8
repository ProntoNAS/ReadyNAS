.SH NAME
a2enconf, a2disconf \- enable or disable an apache2 configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B a2enconf
[ [\-q|\-\-quiet]
.IR configuration ]
.PP
.B a2disconf
[ [\-q|\-\-quiet]
.IR configuration ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B a2enconf
and
.B a2disconf
commands.
.PP
.B a2enconf
is a script that enables the specified configuration file within the
.B apache2
configuration.  It does this by creating symlinks within
.BR /etc/apache2/conf-enabled .
Likewise,
.B a2disconf
disables a specific configuration part by removing those symlinks.  It is not an
error to enable a configuration which is already enabled, or to disable one which is
already disabled.
.PP
Note that many configuration file may have a dependency to specific modules.
Unlike module dependencies, these are not resolved automatically. Configuration
fragments stored in the conf-available directory are considered non-essential or
being installed and manged by reverse dependencies (e.g. web scripts).

.TP
.B \-p, \-\-purge
When disabling a module, purge all traces of the module in the internal state
data base.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
