libdvdread for Debian
---------------------

Many DVDs use css.  To play these discs, a special library is needed
to decode them, libdvdcss.  Due to legal problems, Debian cannot
distribute libdvdcss, but it is available on other places on the
internet.  If it is legal for you to use css, you can run
'/usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh' at any time to
download and install it.
