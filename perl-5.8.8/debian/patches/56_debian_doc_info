-By default, the manpages listed above are installed in the

-Extensive additional documentation for Perl modules is available.  The
-default configuration for perl will place this additional documentation
-in the F</usr/local/lib/perl5/man> directory (or else in the F<man>
-subdirectory of the Perl library directory).  Some of this additional

 You should be able to view Perl's documentation with your man(1)

-environment variable.  If they do not share a stem, you'll have to add
-both stems.
