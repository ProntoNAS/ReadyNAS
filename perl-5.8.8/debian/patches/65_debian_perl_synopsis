As reported in http://bugs.debian.org/278323 , the TOC in perl.pod
should probably not be in the synopsis.

Note NN_debian_ rather than NN_fix_ since it's upstream doesn't agree.

+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary
+text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
+reports based on that information.  It's also a good language for many
+system management tasks.  The language is intended to be practical
+(easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny,
+elegant, minimal).
+
+Perl combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best
+features of C, B<sed>, B<awk>, and B<sh>, so people familiar with
+those languages should have little difficulty with it.  (Language
+historians will also note some vestiges of B<csh>, Pascal, and even
+BASIC-PLUS.)  Expression syntax corresponds closely to C
+expression syntax.  Unlike most Unix utilities, Perl does not
+arbitrarily limit the size of your data--if you've got the memory,
+Perl can slurp in your whole file as a single string.  Recursion is of
+unlimited depth.  And the tables used by hashes (sometimes called
+"associative arrays") grow as necessary to prevent degraded
+performance.  Perl can use sophisticated pattern matching techniques to
+scan large amounts of data quickly.  Although optimized for
+scanning text, Perl can also deal with binary data, and can make dbm
+files look like hashes.  Setuid Perl scripts are safer than C programs
+through a dataflow tracing mechanism that prevents many stupid
+security holes.
+
+If you have a problem that would ordinarily use B<sed> or B<awk> or
+B<sh>, but it exceeds their capabilities or must run a little faster,
+and you don't want to write the silly thing in C, then Perl may be for
+you.  There are also translators to turn your B<sed> and B<awk>
+scripts into Perl scripts.

 If you're new to Perl, you should start with L<perlintro>, which is a 
 general intro for beginners and provides some background to help you
 navigate the rest of Perl's extensive documentation.
