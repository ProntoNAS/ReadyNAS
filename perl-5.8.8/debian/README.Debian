Perl Packages for Debian
========================

  perl             - Larry Wall's Practical Extracting and Report Language.
  perl-base        - The Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.
  perl-modules     - Core Perl modules.
  perl-doc         - Perl documentation.
  perl-debug       - Debug-enabled Perl interpreter.
  perl-suid        - Runs setuid Perl scripts.
  libperl5.8       - Shared Perl library.
  libperl-dev      - Perl library: development files.
  libcgi-fast-perl - CGI::Fast Perl module.

To provide a minimal working perl, the ``perl-base'' package provides
the /usr/bin/perl binary plus a basic set of libraries.

The remainder of the application is included in the perl, perl-modules
and perl-doc packages.

libcgi-fast-perl has been split from -modules as it depends on
libfcgi-perl.

Build Options
-------------

In addition to the ``nostrip'' and ``noopt'' DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
required by policy (10.1) the build process also recognises the
following perl-specific options:

  x-perl-shared
  x-perl-static
    Select whether /usr/bin/perl is linked to the shared or static
    perl library.  By default the link type is shared on all
    architectures other than i386 (where the relocations incur a
    measurable performance penalty).

  x-perl-notest
    The regression test suite is normally run after each of the static
    and shared build phases.  It is occaisionally useful to supress
    these tests (when debugging the build process for example, or to
    allow porters to work around known build chain or kernel bugs).

Patches Applied
----------------

A copy of all patches which have been applied to the source are in the
debian/patches directory of the Debian source package.

There are two classes of patches in the directory:  NN_fix_* patches are
generally applicable to any Perl installation (and usually back-ported
from upstream, or posted to p5p when applied).

Patches from 50 up (NN_debian_*) implement changes which are specific to
the Debian packaging, such as our @INC ordering or specific to policy
such as not including standard directories in LD_RUN_PATH.

Packaging Details
-----------------

The Debian build process consists of the following components:

  debian/rules
    makefile which drives the build process as usual with Debian
    packages.  This process is slightly more complex than normal to
    simplify bootstrapping a new port--using only basic shell utils, and
    perl (once built, as perl.static).  To bootstrap a new architecture,
    use:

      DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE=<arch> debian/rules binary-arch

  debian/config.debian 
    a helper script, invoked by debian/rules to run Configure with
    various options.

  debian/config.over
    used to fiddle some config.sh variables (copied to the source
    directory by the build process where it is picked up by Configure).

  debian/patches
    diretory containg the patches applied (see above).  The procedure
    for adding a new patch is:

      fakeroot debian/rules clean
      debian/rules unpatch

    at this point, the directory should be identical to the upstream
    source with the exception of the debian subdir.  Any changes are
    made, patches applied etc., then:

      (cd ..; diff -Naur --exclude=debian perl-5.8.2.orig perl-5.8.2) \
	  >debian/patches/<new>
      patch -Rp1 <debian/patches/<new>
      debian/rules patch

    The new patch should then be edited to add a descriptive text block
    at the top.

  debian/released-versions
    contains a list of released Debian versions, used by the
    debian/mkprovides script to generate a list of perlapi-<ver>
    provides for perl-base indicating the released versions the package
    is compatible with.

  debian/headers
    list of C headers to process with h2ph, which is run with "-a" to
    pick up any required includes--keep this base list as short as
    possible.

  debian/*.{files{,.static,.shared},docs,moduledocs}
    used to split packages; see the comments/code in the install-stamp
    target of debian/rules.
