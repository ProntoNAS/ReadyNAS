    cups-backend(1).  Closes: #126811.
  * Oops!  Debian has time_t->tm_gmtoff, which is defined to have the
    opposite sign of timezone.  Is it that way on BSD?  Anyway,
    reverse the sense of the sign for time_t->tm_gmtoff if we use
    that.  Closes: #126195.
  * Add header for gs_malloc to pstoraster/gscrdp.c, to prevent
    problems with implicit declaration on 64-bit systems.

    Closes: #117376.
  * Moved CUPS document root from /usr/share/doc/cupsys to
    /usr/share/cups/doc-root, and created a symlink from
    /u/s/d/cupsys/online-docs to it.  It turns out that serving
    files via CUPS from /usr/share/doc is a policy violation.
    Closes: #120923.
  * Fixed a small problem when upgrading from potato libcupsys1-dev
    to current libcupsys2-dev.

  * Removed explicit libcupsys dep from cupsys.
  * Removed "CXX=$CC" from config-scripts/cups-compiler.m4.
  * Removed .SILENT from Makedefs so the build isn't silent anymore.
  * On devfs, look in /dev/printers as well as /dev/parallel.
    (Do we still need /dev/parallel?)  Closes: #114063.
  * Changed internal file: device URI type to test:, since (per
    upstream) it's not intended for anything other than to test
    filters.  See bug #115252 or README.Debian for more info.

cupsys (1.1.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched cupsenable and cupsdisable symlinks to always point to
    /usr/sbin/accept to prevent them from breaking when files move
    around (as they did recently).  Closes: #114006.
  * It turns out that libcupsys needs to make temp files in
    /var/spool/cups/tmp, so that dir needs to be in the package.
    Closes: #115154.
  * Related to the above, when creating temp files, don't loop when
    the open fails unless the return value is EEXIST.  Thanks to Brian
    Ristuccia for the suggestion.
  * Honor the DEB_BUILD_OPTTIONS "debug" setting.
  * Per policy, make sure we build with -D_REENTRANT.
  * Don't remove /var/spool/cups in the cupsys postrm when purging.
  * Added German description to template.  Closes: #113604.
  * Added Portuguese description to cupsys-bsd template.  
    Closes: #106131.

cupsys (1.1.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scale back a bit on aggressiveness on purging cupsys, as it can
    cause us to remove the cupsys-client conffile.
  * It turns out that client.conf is parsed by libcupsys2, not
    cupsys-client, so it needs to switch packages.
  * Changed PAM code so it attempts to open the "cupsys" PAM config
    file, instead of the "cups" one.  Not sure how this broke again.
    Closes: #110651.
  * Per request, implemented the "reload" option in the init script.

  * Replaced kups with kdelibs3-cups in Suggests: lines, and
    reorganized Suggests line.  Closes: #109695.
  * Moved Suggests for all add-on clients to cupsys-client.
  * Fixed purge so /etc/cups is completely cleaned out.
    Closes: #108488.
  * Moved filter and backend man pages to cups-filter and
    cups-backend to avoid conflicts with other packages.
    Closes: #107629.
  * Made the lpd backend non-setuid, and created a low-priority
    debconf question to handle the few who really need it setuid.
    Closes: #77617.
  * Altered cupsys-bsd postinst; always remove any inetd lines when
    removing the package (we'll put it back later if we're just
    upgrading).

    any egregious errors (closes part of bug #52381).
  * Move /var/lib/cups/conf files to /etc/cups, with a symlink in place of
    the old location (closes bug #52318).
  * Added "Authentication failed" message when authorizing after the first
    auth failure (which is likely before the first password request)
    (closes rest of bug #50264).
  * Made cupsys-bsd doc dir a symlink to the cupsys doc files, per policy
    section 6.6 (closes bug #51958).
  * Symlinked /var/lib/cups/logs to /var/log/cups (closes bug #51957).

cupsys (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Conflict with lprng, since lprng includes some SysV printing commands
    (closes bug #50539).
  * Added "cupsenable", "cupsdisable", "cupsaccept", and "cupsreject"
    commands as part of an ongoing effort to reduce namespace pollution.
    (addresses part of bug #50661 and #50384)
  * Set both the default user and group to "lp" (for permissions fixes).
  * Created "lpadmin" group and set SystemGroup to this.  This will
    fix problems with CUPS not being usable initially.  As soon as
    bug #50620 gets fixed, I'll set up to add root to the group, which
    will make root able to configure CUPS immediately after installation.

cupsys (1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong symlinks. (closes bug #50279)
  * Stopped compression of .pdf files; they didn't gain much, broke
    the links in the HTML, and generally caused confusion. (closes
    part of bug #50264)

cupsys (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * cupsys-bsd should conflict with lpr, not "lpd" (whatever that is) 
  (closes #50047)
  
  * Changed priority to "extra".

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Nov 1999 22:24:15 -0600

cupsys (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
