Marvell Cryptographic Engines And Security Accelerator

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following string
	      "marvell,orion-crypto"
	      "marvell,kirkwood-crypto"
	      "marvell,armada-370-crypto"
	      "marvell,armada-xp-crypto"
	      "marvell,armada-375-crypto"
	      "marvell,armada-38x-crypto"
- reg: base physical address of the engine and length of memory mapped
       region
- reg-names: "regs"
- interrupts: interrupt number
- clocks: reference to the crypto engines clocks. This property is not
	  required for orion and kirkwood platforms
- clock-names: "cesaX" and "cesazX", X should be replaced by the crypto engine
	       id.
	       This property is not required for the orion and kirkwoord
	       platforms.
	       "cesazX" clocks are not required on armada-370 platforms
- marvell,crypto-srams: phandle to crypto SRAM definitions

Optional properties:
- marvell,crypto-sram-size: SRAM size reserved for crypto operations, if not
			    specified the whole SRAM is used (2KB)

Deprecated properties:
- reg: base physical address of the engine and length of memory mapped
       region, followed by base physical address of sram and its memory
       length
- reg-names: "regs" , "sram"

Examples:

	crypto@90000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-xp-crypto";
		reg = <0x90000 0x10000>;
		reg-names = "regs";
		interrupts = <48>, <49>;
		clocks = <&gateclk 23>, <&gateclk 23>;
		clock-names = "cesa0", "cesa1";
		marvell,crypto-srams = <&crypto_sram0>, <&crypto_sram1>;
		marvell,crypto-sram-size = <0x600>;
		status = "okay";
	};
