.SH DESCRIPTION
lvextend allows you to extend the size of a logical volume.
Extension of snapshot logical volumes (see
.B lvcreate(8)
for information to create snapshots) is supported as well.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-l, \-\-extents [+]LogicalExtentsNumber
Extend or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size
of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.
.TP
.I \-L, \-\-size [+]LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtT]
Extend or set the logical volume size in units in units of megabytes.
A size suffix of M for megabytes, G for gigabytes or T for terabytes is
optional.  With the + sign the value is added to the actual size
of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.
.TP
.I \-i, \-\-stripes Stripes
Gives the number of stripes for the extension.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout.
.TP
.I \-I, \-\-stripesize StripeSize
Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout.
.br
StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9)
.SH Examples
"lvextend -L +54 /dev/vg01/lvol10 /dev/sdk3" tries to extend the size of
that logical volume by 54MB on physical volume /dev/sdk3.
This is only possible if /dev/sdk3 is a member of volume group vg01 and
there are enough free physical extents in it.
