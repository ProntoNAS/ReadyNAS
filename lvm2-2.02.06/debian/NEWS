lvm2 (2.02.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  This release enables md_component_detection by default. If pvscan fails to
  find a device which was part of a linux softraid, clear the superblock which
  lives in the last 4k of the device.

  This release adds support to overwrite permissions for devices. This feature
  is controlled by a device_permissions setting in the activation group in
  /etc/lvm/lvm.conf.
