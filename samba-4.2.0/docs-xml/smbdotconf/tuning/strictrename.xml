    <para>By default a Windows SMB server prevents directory
    renames when there are open file or directory handles below
    it in the filesystem hierarchy. Historically Samba has always
    allowed this as POSIX filesystem semantics require it.</para>

    <para>This boolean parameter allows Samba to match the Windows
    behavior. Setting this to "yes" is a very expensive change,
    as it forces Samba to travers the entire open file handle
    database on every directory rename request. In a clustered
    Samba system the cost is even greater than the non-clustered
    case.</para>

    <para>For this reason the default is "no", and it is recommended
    to be left that way unless a specific Windows application requires
    it to be changed.</para>
