Subject: [SHELL] Disable sh -c "command" -> sh -c "exec command" optimization

Bugs #642706 (bin-prot FTBFS) and #642835 (sexplib310 FTBFS) can be
fixed by reverting the patch submitted at [1]. I don't understand why.

[1] http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.dash/556

While investigating #642706, in the failing case, I observed that a
cpp process called with "sh -c" gets SIGPIPE while writing to
stderr. In the succeeding case, the write is successful, and is read
by the ocamlbuild process that started "sh -c cpp ...".
