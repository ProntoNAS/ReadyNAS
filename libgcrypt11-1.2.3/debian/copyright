Excerpt from upstream's README:

    License
    -------
    
    Most of this library is distributed under the terms of the GNU
    Lesser General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for
    the actual terms.  However some parts are distributed under the
    GNU General Public License (GPL) so if you configure Libgcrypt to
    include these modules, you have to comply with the conditions of
    the GPL as found in the file COPYING.  The modules under the GPL
    are:

      rndunix - Entropy gatherer for Unices without a /dev/random
      rndw32  - Entropy gatherer for MS Windows

    This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed
    with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free
    crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities
    similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of
    cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more
    sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities
    between some Free Software licenses and the GPL. 

    Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be
    licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free
    software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does
    less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it
    covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for
    more explanation.
