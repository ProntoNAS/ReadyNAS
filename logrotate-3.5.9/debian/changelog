logrotate (3.5.9-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added check to cron.daily (blatantly stolen from exim's) to only

    "should" policy directive) gets into woody.

  * Further development on bug #118466. Use stat() rather than
    fgetc/ungetc. Thanks to Ian Wienand <ianw@ieee.org> for being

    (Closes: #119176)

logrotate (3.5.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed rotation of /var/log/lastlog. It's a file that doesn't grow,
    and rotating it loses all the lastlog information. Perhaps making
    a backup would make more sense. (Closes: #111184)

  * Moved the status file from /var/lib/logrotate.status which is lame to
    /var/state/logrotate/status
  * I spaced the use of /bin/mail---oops.  It's a symlink on this system so
