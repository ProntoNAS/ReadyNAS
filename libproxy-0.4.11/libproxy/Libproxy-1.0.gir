A NULL-terminated array of proxy strings is returned.
If the first proxy fails, the second should be tried, etc...
Don't forget to free the strings/array when you are done.
If an unrecoverable error occurs, this function returns NULL.
in a separate thread (is thread-safe).  In most cases, the time
required to complete this function call is simply the time required
to read the configuration (i.e. from gconf, kconfig, etc).
In the case of PAC, if no valid PAC is found in the cache (i.e.
configuration has changed, cache is invalid, etc), the PAC file is
downloaded and inserted into the cache. This is the most expensive
operation as the PAC is retrieved over the network. Once a PAC exists
in the cache, it is merely a javascript invocation to evaluate the PAC.
One should note that DNS can be called from within a PAC during
javascript invocation.
In the case of WPAD, WPAD is used to automatically locate a PAC on the
network.  Currently, we only use DNS for this, but other methods may
be implemented in the future.  Once the PAC is located, normal PAC
performance (described above) applies.
The format of the returned proxy strings are as follows:
- http://[username:password@]proxy:port
- socks://[username:password@]proxy:port
- socks5://[username:password@]proxy:port
- socks4://[username:password@]proxy:port
- &lt;procotol&gt;://[username:password@]proxy:port
- direct://
Please note that the username and password in the above URLs are optional
and should be use to authenticate the connection if present.
For SOCKS proxies, when the protocol version is specified (socks4:// or
sock5://), it is expected that only this version is used. When only
socks:// is set, the client MUST try SOCKS version 5 protocol and, on
connection failure, fallback to SOCKS version 4.
Other proxying protocols may exist. It is expected that the returned
configuration scheme shall match the network service name of the
proxy protocol or the service name of the protocol being proxied if the
previous does not exist. As an example, on Mac OS X you can configure a
RTSP streaming proxy. The expected returned configuration would be:
- rtsp://[username:password@]proxy:port</doc>
