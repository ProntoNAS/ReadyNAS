Subject: Resolve includes for hardware specific accesses directory
 When using the #include directive in an AppArmor profile, the parser should
 search /usr/share/apparmor in addition to /etc/apparmor.d.
 .
 This is needed because Ubuntu places hardware specific access rules in
 /usr/share/apparmor/hardware.
 .
 Note that the addition of this search patch may result in namespace collisions
 among the two include directories.
