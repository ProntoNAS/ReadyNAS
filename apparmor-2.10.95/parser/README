The apparmor_parser allows you to add, replace, and remove AppArmor
policy through the use of command line options. The default is to add.
`apparmor_parser --help` shows what the command line options are.

Please send all complaints, feature requests, rants about the software,
and questions to the apparmor@lists.ubuntu.com mailing list. Bug
reports can be filed against the AppArmor project on launchpad.net at
https://launchpad.net/apparmor or reported to the mailing list directly
for those who wish not to register for an account on launchpad.

Security issues can be filed as security bugs on launchpad
or directed to security@ubuntu.com. We will attempt to
conform to the RFP vulnerability disclosure protocol:

Thanks.
