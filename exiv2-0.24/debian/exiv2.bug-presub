If you know that the bug you want to report is in the "upstream"
code then please file a bug report in the exiv2 bug tracking system
on the web at http://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/issues

If you feel that the bug is one that other Debian users should
know about then you are welcome to file a report in the Debian BTS
as well.  Please keep in mind, however, that managing bug reports
is part of the maintainers' workload.
