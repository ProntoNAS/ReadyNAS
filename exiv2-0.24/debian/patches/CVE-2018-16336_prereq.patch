+  @brief Convert a (potentially not null terminated) array into a
+  std::string.
+
+  Convert a C style string that may or may not be null terminated safely
+  into a std::string. The string's termination is either set at the first \0
+  or after data_length characters.
+
+  @param[in] data  A c-string from which the std::string shall be
+      constructed. Does not need to be null terminated.
+  @param[in] data_length  An upper bound for the string length (must be at most
+      the allocated length of `buffer`). If no null terminator is found in data,
+      then the resulting std::string will be null terminated at `data_length`.
