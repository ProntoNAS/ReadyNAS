Subject: Do not fetch external parsed entities

Unless explicietely asked for when validating or replacing entities
with their value. Problem pointed out by Tom Lane <tgl@redhat.com>

* parser.c: do not load external parsed entities unless needed
* test/errors/extparsedent.xml result/errors/extparsedent.xml*:
  add a regression test to avoid change of the behaviour in the future
