#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"This version of OpenSSH has a considerably changed configuration file from "
"the version shipped in Debian 'Potato', which you appear to be upgrading "
"from. This package can now generate a new configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd."

"any customisations you made with the old version."

"Please note that this new configuration file will set the value of "
"'PermitRootLogin' to yes (meaning that anyone knowing the root password can "
"ssh directly in as root). It is the opinion of the maintainer that this is "
"the correct default (see README.Debian for more details), but you can always "
"edit sshd_config and set it to no if you wish."

"Password authentication appears to be disabled in your current OpenSSH "
