openssh (1:4.3p2-5~bpo.1) sarge-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt for sarge.
  * Remove versioned Build-Dependency on libssl-dev, as the maintainer says it
    can be safely ignored.
  * Pass --without-zlib-version-check to configure as zlib has already been
    fixed in sarge by DSA-763-1.
  * Removed -Wno-pointer-sign from configure.

openssh (1:4.3p2-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backport from 4.4p1 (since I don't have an updated version of the GSSAPI
    patch yet):
    - CVE-2006-4924: Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by
      Tavis Ormandy, that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace
      time expired (closes: #389995).
    - CVE-2006-5051: Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The
      signal handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be
      exploited to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On
      portable OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
      pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication is
      enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears remote.

  * Read /etc/default/locale as well as /etc/environment (thanks, Raphaël
    Hertzog; closes: #369395).
  * Remove no-longer-used ssh/insecure_rshd debconf template.
  * Make ssh/insecure_telnetd Type: error (closes: #388946).

  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Portuguese (thanks, Rui Branco; closes: #381942).
    - Update Spanish (thanks, Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña;
      closes: #382966).

openssh (1:4.3p2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include commented-out pam_access example in /etc/pam.d/ssh.
  * On '/etc/init.d/ssh restart', create /var/run/sshd before checking the
    server configuration, as otherwise 'sshd -t' will complain about the
    lack of /var/run/sshd (closes: https://launchpad.net/bugs/45234).

openssh (1:4.3p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #361032).
    - CVE-2006-0225: scp (as does rcp, on which it is based) invoked a
      subshell to perform local to local, and remote to remote copy
      operations. This subshell exposed filenames to shell expansion twice;
      allowing a local attacker to create filenames containing shell
      metacharacters that, if matched by a wildcard, could lead to execution
      of attacker-specified commands with the privilege of the user running
      scp (closes: #349645).
    - Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a connection
      between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual network
      interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create a true VPN
      between the client and server providing real network connectivity at
      layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental.
    - Reduce default key length for new DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen
      back to 1024 bits. DSA is not specified for longer lengths and does
      not fully benefit from simply making keys longer. As per FIPS 186-2
      Change Notice 1, ssh-keygen will refuse to generate a new DSA key
      smaller or larger than 1024 bits.
    - Fixed X forwarding failing to start when the X11 client is executed in
      background at the time of session exit.
    - Change ssh-keygen to generate a protocol 2 RSA key when invoked
      without arguments (closes: #114894).
    - Fix timing variance for valid vs. invalid accounts when attempting
      Kerberos authentication.
    - Ensure that ssh always returns code 255 on internal error
      (closes: #259865).
    - Cleanup wtmp files on SIGTERM when not using privsep.
    - Set SO_REUSEADDR on X11 listeners to avoid problems caused by
      lingering sockets from previous session (X11 applications can
      sometimes not connect to 127.0.0.1:60xx) (closes:
      https://launchpad.net/bugs/25528).
    - Ensure that fds 0, 1 and 2 are always attached in all programs, by
      duping /dev/null to them if necessary.
    - Xauth list invocation had bogus "." argument.
    - Remove internal assumptions on key exchange hash algorithm and output
      length, preparing OpenSSH for KEX methods with alternate hashes.
    - Ignore junk sent by a server before it sends the "SSH-" banner.
    - Many manual page improvements.
    - Lots of cleanups, including fixes to memory leaks on error paths and
      possible crashes.
  * Update to current GSSAPI patch from
    http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh-4.3p2-gsskex-20060223.patch
    (closes: #352042).
  * debian/rules: Resynchronise CFLAGS with that generated by configure.
  * Restore pam_nologin to /etc/pam.d/ssh; sshd no longer checks this itself
    when PAM is enabled, but relies on PAM to do it.
  * Rename KeepAlive to TCPKeepAlive in default sshd_config
    (closes: #349896).
  * Rephrase ssh/new_config and ssh/encrypted_host_key_but_no_keygen debconf
    templates to make boolean short descriptions end with a question mark
    and to avoid use of the first person.
  * Ship README.tun.
  * Policy version 3.7.2: no changes required.
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Italian (thanks, Luca Monducci; closes: #360348).
    - Add Galician (thanks, Jacobo Tarrio; closes: #361220).

openssh (1:4.2p1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Use udeb support introduced in debhelper 4.2.0 (available in sarge)
    rather than constructing udebs by steam.
  * Require debhelper 5.0.22, which generates correct shared library
    dependencies for udebs (closes: #360068). This build-dependency can be
    ignored if building on sarge.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 4, since we now require
    debhelper 4 even on sarge anyway for udeb support.

openssh (1:4.2p1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * I accidentally applied the default $PATH change in 1:4.2p1-6 to the udeb
    rather than the deb. Fixed.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Mar 2006 16:19:00 +0000

openssh (1:4.2p1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync default values of $PATH from shadow 1:4.0.12-6, adding /usr/bin/X11
    to the normal and superuser paths and /usr/games to the normal path.
  * When the client receives a signal, don't fatal() with "Killed by signal
    %d." (which produces unhelpful noise on stderr and causes confusion for
    users of some applications that wrap ssh); instead, generate a debug
    message and exit with the traditional status (closes: #313371).
  * debconf template translations:
    - Add Swedish (thanks, Daniel Nylander; closes: #333133).
    - Update Spanish (thanks, Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña;
      closes: #341371).
    - Correct erroneously-changed Last-Translator headers in Greek and
      Spanish translations.

  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev on armeb.
  * Only send GSSAPI proposal if GSSAPIAuthentication is enabled.
  * Build-depend on libssl-dev (>= 0.9.8-1) to cope with surprise OpenSSL
    transition, since otherwise who knows what the buildds will do. If
    you're building openssh yourself, you can safely ignore this and use an
    older libssl-dev.

openssh (1:4.2p1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Interoperate with ssh-krb5 << 3.8.1p1-1 servers, which used a slightly
    different version of the gssapi authentication method (thanks, Aaron M.
    Ucko; closes: #328388).
  * Explicitly tell po2debconf to use the 'popular' output encoding, so that
    the woody-compatibility hack works even with po-debconf 0.9.0.

    - Add GSSAPI key exchange support from
      http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh.html (thanks, Stephen
      Frost).
    - Build-depend on libkrb5-dev and configure --with-kerberos5=/usr.
    - openssh-client and openssh-server replace ssh-krb5.
    - Update commented-out Kerberos/GSSAPI options in default sshd_config.
    - Fix HAVE_GSSAPI_KRB5_H/HAVE_GSSAPI_GSSAPI_KRB5_H typos in
      gss-serv-krb5.c.

openssh (1:4.2p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY (CAN-2005-2797): Fix a bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0 that
      caused GatewayPorts to be incorrectly activated for dynamic ("-D")
      port forwardings when no listen address was explicitly specified
      (closes: #326065).
    - SECURITY (CAN-2005-2798): Fix improper delegation of GSSAPI
      credentials. This code is only built in openssh-krb5, not openssh, but
      I mention the CVE reference here anyway for completeness.
    - Add a new compression method ("Compression delayed") that delays zlib
      compression until after authentication, eliminating the risk of zlib
      vulnerabilities being exploited by unauthenticated users. Note that
      users of OpenSSH versions earlier than 3.5 will need to disable
      compression on the client or set "Compression yes" (losing this
      security benefit) on the server.
    - Increase the default size of new RSA/DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen
      from 1024 to 2048 bits (closes: #181162).
    - Many bugfixes and improvements to connection multiplexing.
    - Don't pretend to accept $HOME (closes: #208648).
  * debian/rules: Resynchronise CFLAGS with that generated by configure.
  * openssh-client and openssh-server conflict with pre-split ssh to avoid
    problems when ssh is left un-upgraded (closes: #324695).
  * Set X11Forwarding to yes in the default sshd_config (new installs only).
    At least when X11UseLocalhost is turned on, which is the default, the
    security risks of using X11 forwarding are risks to the client, not to
    the server (closes: #320104).

openssh (1:4.1p1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do the IDEA host key check on a temporary file to avoid altering
    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key itself (closes: #312312).
  * Work around the ssh-askpass alternative somehow ending up in manual mode
    pointing to the obsolete /usr/lib/ssh/gnome-ssh-askpass.
  * Add GNU/kFreeBSD support (thanks, Aurelien Jarno; closes: #318113).
  * Fix XSIish uses of 'test' in openssh-server.preinst.
  * Policy version 3.6.2: no changes required.

openssh (1:4.1p1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev on ppc64 too (closes: #314625).
  * Drop priority of ssh to extra to match the override file.
  * Make /usr/share/doc/openssh-server and /usr/share/doc/ssh symlinks to
    /usr/share/doc/openssh-client (closes: #314745).
  * Ship README.dns (closes: #284874).
  * Disable btmp logging, since Debian's /var/log/btmp has inappropriate
    permissions (closes: #314956).
  * Allow ~/.ssh/config to be group-writable, provided that the group in
    question contains only the file's owner (closes: #314347).
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Brazilian Portuguese (thanks, André Luís Lopes;

openssh (1:4.1p1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * openssh-client and openssh-server conflict with ssh-krb5, as ssh-krb5
    only conflicts with ssh (closes: #312475).
  * SELinux support (thanks, Manoj Srivastava; closes: #308555):
    - Added SELinux capability, and turned it on be default. Added
      restorecon calls in preinst and postinst (should not matter if the
      machine is not SELinux aware). By and large, the changes made should
      have no effect unless the rules file calls --with-selinux; and even
      then there should be no performance hit for machines not actively
      running SELinux.
    - Modified the preinst and postinst to call restorecon to set the
      security context for the generated public key files.
    - Added a comment to /etc/pam.d/ssh to indicate that an SELinux system
      may want to also include pam_selinux.so.
  * Re-enable ssh-askpass-gnome on the Hurd, now that its build-dependencies
    are available.
  * Restore /usr/lib/sftp-server temporarily, as a symlink to
    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server (closes: #312891).
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 3, since 2 is deprecated.
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update German (thanks, Jens Seidel; closes: #313949).

openssh (1:4.1p1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Drop debconf support for allowing SSH protocol 1, which is discouraged
    and has not been the default since openssh 1:3.0.1p1-1. Users who need
    this should edit sshd_config instead (closes: #147212).
  * Since ssh-keysign isn't used by default (you need to set
    EnableSSHKeysign to "yes" in /etc/ssh/ssh_config), having a debconf
    question to ask whether it should be setuid is overkill, and the
    question text had got out of date anyway. Remove this question, ship
    ssh-keysign setuid in openssh-client.deb, and set a statoverride if the
    debconf question was previously set to false.
  * Add lintian overrides for the above (setuid-binary,
    no-debconf-templates).
  * Fix picky lintian errors about slogin symlinks.
  * Fix DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS/DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM compatibility handling.
  * Apply Linux 2.2 workaround (see #239999) only on Linux.

openssh (1:4.1p1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Normalise socket addresses returned by get_remote_hostname(), fixing
      4-in-6 mapping issues with AllowUsers et al (closes: #192234).
  * Take upstream's hint and disable the unsupported USE_POSIX_THREADS
    (closes: #295757, #308868, and possibly others; may open other bugs).
    Use PAM password authentication to avoid #278394. In future I may
    provide two sets of binaries built with and without this option, since
    it seems I can't win.
  * Disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication in new installations, returning
    to PasswordAuthentication by default, since it now supports PAM and
    apparently works better with a non-threaded sshd (closes: #247521).
  * openssh-server Suggests: rssh (closes: #233012).
  * Change libexecdir to /usr/lib/openssh, and fix up various alternatives
    and configuration files to match (closes: #87900, #151321).
  * Fix up very old sshd_config files that refer to /usr/libexec/sftp-server
    (closes: #141979).

openssh (1:4.0p1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Port-forwarding specifications now take optional bind addresses, and
      the server allows client-specified bind addresses for remote port
      forwardings when configured with "GatewayPorts clientspecified"
      (closes: #87253, #192206).
    - ssh and ssh-keyscan now support hashing of known_hosts files for
      improved privacy (CAN-2005-2666). ssh-keygen has new options for
      managing known_hosts files, which understand hashing.
    - sftp supports command history and editing support using libedit
      (closes: #287013).
    - Have scp and sftp wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they exit
      themselves, allowing ssh to restore terminal modes (closes: #257130).
    - Improved the handling of bad data in authorized_keys files,
      eliminating fatal errors on corrupt or very large keys; e.g. linefeeds
      in keys only produce errors in auth.log now (closes: #220726).
    - Add "command mode" to ssh connection multiplexing (closes: #303452).
    - Mention $HOME/.hushlogin in sshd(8) FILES section (closes: #163933).
  * Make gnome-ssh-askpass stay above other windows (thanks, Liyang HU;
    closes: #296487).
  * Remove obsolete and unnecessary ssh/forward_warning debconf note.
  * Hurd build fixes (although sshd still doesn't work):
    - Restore X forwarding fix from #102991, lost somewhere along the way.
    - Link with -lcrypt.
    - Link with -lpthread rather than -pthread.
    - Don't build ssh-askpass-gnome on the Hurd, until GNOME is available to
      satisfy build-dependencies.
  * Drop workaround for #242462 on amd64; it's been fixed properly upstream.
  * Enable HashKnownHosts by default. This only affects new entries; use
    'ssh-keygen -H' to convert an entire known_hosts file to hashed format.
  * Note in ssh_config(5) that the SetupTimeOut option is Debian-specific
    (closes: #307069).
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Czech (thanks, Miroslav Kure; closes: #298744).
    - Update Finnish (thanks, Matti Pöllä; closes: #303787).
    - Synchronise Spanish with sarge branch (thanks, Javier
      Fernández-Sanguino Peña; closes: #298536).
    - Add Ukrainian (thanks, Eugeniy Meshcheryakov; closes: #301852).

    - Fix res_query detection (closes: #242462).
    - 'ssh -c' documentation improved (closes: #265627).
  * Pass LANG and LC_* environment variables from the client by default, and

    This is of course a bug in those implementations, but since the extent
    of the problem is unknown it's best to play safe (closes: #275731).

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-11) experimental; urgency=high

  * Move sshd_config(5) to openssh-server, where it belongs.
  * If PasswordAuthentication is disabled, then offer to disable
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication too. The current PAM code will attempt
    password-style authentication if ChallengeResponseAuthentication is
    enabled (closes: #250369).
  * This will ask a question of anyone who installed fresh with 1:3.8p1-2 or
    later and then upgraded. Sorry about that ... for this reason, the
    default answer is to leave ChallengeResponseAuthentication enabled.

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-10) experimental; urgency=low

  * Don't install the ssh-askpass-gnome .desktop file by default; I've had

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Split the ssh binary package into openssh-client and openssh-server
    (closes: #39741). openssh-server depends on openssh-client for some
    common functionality; it didn't seem worth creating yet another package
    for this. openssh-client is priority standard, openssh-server optional.
  * New transitional ssh package, priority optional, depending on
    openssh-client and openssh-server. May be removed once nothing depends
    on it.
  * When upgrading from ssh to openssh-{client,server}, it's very difficult
    for the maintainer scripts to find out what version we're upgrading from
    without dodgy dpkg hackery. I've therefore taken the opportunity to move
    a couple of debconf notes into NEWS files, namely ssh/ssh2_keys_merged
    and ssh/user_environment_tell.
  * Add a heuristic to try to make sure the sshd_config upgrade to >= 3.7
    happens even though we don't know what version we're upgrading from.
  * Remove /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run on purge of openssh-server. For now
    (until sarge+2) it's still honoured to avoid breaking existing
    configurations, but the right approach is now to remove the
    openssh-server package if you don't want to run the server. Add a NEWS
    item to that effect.

  * Generate a new .orig.tar.gz without RFC.nroff, and remove
    /usr/share/doc/ssh/RFC.gz (closes: #211640). It isn't DFSG-free and only
    documents the obsolete SSH1 protocol, not to mention that it was never a

    it for some reason.

openssh (1:3.8p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #232281):
    - New PAM implementation based on that in FreeBSD. This runs PAM session
      modules before dropping privileges (closes: #132681, #150968).
    - Since PAM session modules are run as root, we can turn pam_limits back
      on by default, and it no longer spits out "Operation not permitted" to
      syslog (closes: #171673).
    - Password expiry works again (closes: #153235).
    - 'ssh -q' suppresses login banner (closes: #134589).
    - sshd doesn't lie to PAM about invalid usernames (closes: #157078).
    - ssh-add prints key comment on each prompt (closes: #181869).
    - Punctuation formatting fixed in man pages (closes: #191131).
    - EnableSSHKeysign documented in ssh_config(5) (closes: #224457).
  * Add 'UsePAM yes' to /etc/ssh/sshd_config on upgrade from versions older
    than this, to maintain the standard Debian sshd configuration.
  * Comment out PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt and RhostsAuthentication in
    sshd_config on upgrade. Neither option is supported any more.
  * Privilege separation and PAM are now properly supported together, so
    remove both debconf questions related to them and simply set it
    unconditionally in newly generated sshd_config files (closes: #228838).
  * ServerAliveInterval implemented upstream, so ProtocolKeepAlives is now a
    compatibility alias. The semantics differ slightly, though; see
    ssh_config(5) for details.
  * Implement SSH1 support for ServerAliveInterval using SSH_MSG_IGNORE. As
    documented in ssh_config(5), it's not as good as the SSH2 version.
  * Remove -fno-builtin-log, -DHAVE_MMAP_ANON_SHARED, and
    -D__FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 compiler options, which are no longer necessary.
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20040105.1.
  * Darren Tucker:
    - Reset signal status when starting pam auth thread, prevent hanging
      during PAM keyboard-interactive authentications.
    - Fix a non-security-critical segfault in PAM authentication.
  * Add debconf template translations:
    - Greek (thanks, Konstantinos Margaritis; closes: #232843).
    - Italian (thanks, Renato Gini; closes: #234777).

  * Policy version 3.5.9: support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt, build
    gnome-ssh-askpass with -g and -Wall flags.
  * Really ask ssh/new_config debconf question before trying to fetch its
    value (closes: #188721).
  * On purge, remove only the files we know about in /etc/ssh rather than
    the whole thing, and remove the directory if that leaves it empty
    (closes: #176679).
  * ssh has depended on debconf for some time now with no complaints, so:
    - Simplify the postinst by relying on debconf being present. (The absent
      case was buggy anyway.)
    - Get rid of "if you have not installed debconf" text in README.Debian,
      and generally update the "/usr/bin/ssh not SUID" entry.
  * More README.Debian work:
    - Reorganize into "UPGRADE ISSUES" and "OTHER ISSUES", in an effort to
      make it easier for people to find the former. The upgrade issues
      should probably be sorted by version somehow.
    - Document X11UseLocalhost under "X11 Forwarding" (closes: #150913).

openssh (1:3.5p1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add /etc/default/ssh (closes: #161049).
  * Run the init script under 'set -e' (closes: #175010).
  * Change the default superuser path to include /sbin, /usr/sbin, and
    /usr/local/sbin (closes: #128235, #151267). Using login.defs would be
    nice, but that belongs to another package. Without a defined API to
    retrieve its settings, parsing it is off-limits.
  * Build ssh-askpass-gnome with GNOME 2. The source package should still
    support building on stable with GNOME 1, using the alternate
    libgnome-dev build-dependency (thanks, Colin Walters; closes: #167582).

openssh (1:3.5p1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Point rlogin and rcp alternatives at slogin and scp respectively rather
    than ssh (closes: #121103, #151666). Fix alternative removal to match;
    previously it was completely wrong anyway.
  * Find out whether /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run exists and set the debconf
    question's default using that information, rather than using debconf as
    a registry. Other solutions may be better in the long run, but this is
    at least correct (thanks, Matthew Woodcraft; closes: #84725).
  * Stop using pam_lastlog, as it doesn't currently work well as a session
    module when privilege separation is enabled; it can usually read
    /var/log/lastlog but can't write to it. Instead, just use sshd's
    built-in support, already enabled by default (closes: #151297, #169938).
  * Use 'ssh-keygen -q' rather than redirecting output to /dev/null.
  * Add a "this may take some time" warning when creating host keys on
    installation (part of #110094).
  * When restarting via the init script, check for sshd_not_to_be_run after
    stopping sshd (idea from Tomas Pospisek; closes: #149850).
  * Append /usr/sbin:/sbin to the init script's $PATH, just in case of
    strangeness (closes: #115138).
  * Fix a dpkg-statoverride call to redirect stdout to /dev/null, not
    stderr.
  * Correct copyright file typo: "orignal" -> "original" (closes: #176490).
  * Rebuild with libssl0.9.7 (closes: #176983).
  * We're up to policy version 3.5.6. DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS stuff still needs to
    be looked at.

openssh (1:3.5p1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use getent rather than id to find out whether the sshd user exists
    (closes: #150974).
  * Remove some duplication from the postinst's ssh-keysign setuid code.
  * Replace db_text with db_input throughout debian/config. (db_text has
    been a compatibility wrapper since debconf 0.1.5.)
  * Warn about PermitUserEnvironment on upgrade (closes: #167895).
  * Use 'make install-nokeys', and disable unused debhelper commands,
    thereby forward-porting the last pieces of Zack Weinberg's patch
    (closes: #68341).
  * Move the man page for gnome-ssh-askpass from the ssh package to
    ssh-askpass-gnome (closes: #174449).
  * Build with -DLOGIN_NO_ENDOPT, since Debian's /bin/login doesn't accept
    '--' to terminate the list of options (closes: #171554).
  * Add Jonathan Amery's ssh-argv0 script (closes: #111341).
  * Update Danish debconf template (thanks, Morten Brix Pedersen;
    closes: #174757).
  * Document setgid ssh-agent's effect on certain environment variables in
    README.Debian (closes: #167974).
  * Document interoperability problems between scp and ssh.com's server in
    README.Debian, and suggest some workarounds (closes: #174662).

openssh (1:3.5p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes typo in ssh-add usage (closes: #152239).
    - Fixes 'PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only' (closes: #166184).
    - ~/.ssh/environment and environment= options in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      are deprecated for security reasons and will eventually go away. For
      now they can be re-enabled by setting 'PermitUserEnvironment yes' in
      sshd_config.
    - ssh-agent is installed setgid to prevent ptrace() attacks. The group
      actually doesn't matter, as it drops privileges immediately, but to
      avoid confusion the postinst creates a new 'ssh' group for it.
  * Obsolete patches:
    - Solar Designer's privsep+compression patch for Linux 2.2 (see
      1:3.3p1-0.0woody1).
    - Hostbased auth ssh-keysign backport (see 1:3.4p1-4).

  * Remove duplicated phrase in ssh_config(5) (closes: #152404).
  * Source the debconf confmodule at the top of the postrm rather than at
    the bottom, to avoid making future non-idempotency problems worse (see
    #151035).
  * Debconf templates:
    - Add Polish (thanks, Grzegorz Kusnierz).
    - Update French (thanks, Denis Barbier; closes: #132509).
    - Update Spanish (thanks, Carlos Valdivia Yagüe; closes: #164716).
  * Write a man page for gnome-ssh-askpass, and link it to ssh-askpass.1 if
    this is the selected ssh-askpass alternative (closes: #67775).

  * Drop ssh-askpass-gnome's priority to optional, per the override file.

  * s/dile/idle/ in ssh_config(5) (closes: #118331).

  * Split debconf templates into one file per language.
  * Add debconf template translations:

  * Integrated man page addition for PrintLastLog.
    This bug was filed on "openssh", and I ended up
    creating my own patch for this (closes: #59054)
  * Improved error message when ssh_exchange_identification
    gets EOF (closes: #58904)
  * Fixed typo (your -> you're) in debian/preinst.
  * Added else-clauses to config to make this upgradepath possible:
    oldssh -> openssh preinst fails due to upgrade_to_openssh=false
    -> ssh-nonfree -> openssh. Without these, debconf remembered
    the old answer, config didn't force asking it, and preinst always
    aborted (closes: #56596, #57782)
  * Moved setting upgrade_to_openssh isdefault flag to the place
    where preinst would abort. This means no double question to most
    users, people who currently suffer from "can't upgrade" may need
    to run apt-get install ssh twice. Did not do the same for 
    use_old_init_script, as the situation is a bit different, and
    less common (closes: #54010, #56224)
  * Check for existance of ssh-keygen before attempting to use it in
    preinst, added warning for non-existant ssh-keygen in config. This
    happens when the old ssh is removed (say, due to ssh-nonfree getting
    installed).
