Provides: rsh-client, ssh-client
Description: Secure shell client, an rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.

Package: ssh
Priority: extra
Architecture: all
Depends: openssh-client, openssh-server
Description: Secure shell client and server (transitional package)
 This is a transitional package depending on both the OpenSSH client and
 the OpenSSH server, which are now in separate packages. You may remove
 it once the upgrade is complete and nothing depends on it.

Package: ssh-askpass-gnome
Section: gnome
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, openssh-client | ssh (>= 1:1.2pre7-4) | ssh-krb5
Replaces: ssh (<< 1:3.5p1-3)
Provides: ssh-askpass
Description: under X, asks user for a passphrase for ssh-add
 This has been split out of the main ssh package, so that the ssh will
 not need to depend upon the Gnome libraries.
 .
 You probably want the ssh-askpass package instead, but this is
 provided to add to your choice and/or confusion.

Description: Secure shell client for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 This package provides the ssh client for use in debian-installer.

Package: openssh-server-udeb

Description: Secure shell server for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server for use in debian-installer.
 Since it is expected to be used in specialized situations (e.g. S/390
 installs with no console), it does not provide any configuration.
