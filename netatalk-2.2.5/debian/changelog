netatalk (1.5.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Offically re-enabled OpenSSL support. Rationale: In the OpenSSL FAQ[1]
    it says:

      2. Can I use OpenSSL with GPL software?

      On many systems including the major Linux and BSD distributions, yes (the
      GPL does not place restrictions on using libraries that are part of the
      normal operating system distribution).

    Also, Debian does not infringe on the copyright of the Netatalk team,
    since we (the Netatalk team) clearly intend Netatalk to be linked
    against OpenSSL. (OpenSSL support is on by default.)

    OpenSSL support was on by accident since a few version back anyways.
    Now removed the part about enabling OpenSSL support from README.Debian
    and added appropriate build dependencies.

    pollution of afile.

    (Suggestion by Aubin Paul.)
  * The init script is now able to start AppleTalk daemons in the background.
    (See /etc/default/netatalk.) This was a much-requested feature and we
    can also remove the patches to netatalk.conf and its man page. And -
    most importantly - it fixes a four-figure and a "wontfix" wishlist bug!

      hope that Jonas' patch can go upstream.
    + 014_--sysconfdir_is_included_with_--enable-fhs
      Remove --sysconfdir from ./configure flags.

    apple_rm(1), written by Lance Levsen <l.levsen@printwest.com>.
    Removed the links to undocumented(7).
  * Don't supply --with-did=last anymore, since this is now the default.

    + 012_logcheck_corrections
  * Also "fixed" uams_dhx_pam.so. (Closes: #120360)

    Zimmerman and his spell checking effort for pointing this out.

netatalk (1.5pre8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Explain why we don't link against OpenSSL in README.Debian.
  * Modified debian/rules so that setting a variable called USE_SSL to
    "yes" enables SSL support. This should ease the local compilation of
    SSL-enabled netatalk packages.

netatalk (1.5pre8-2) unstable; urgency=low

      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser. (Patch had already been applied in

  * Integrated a lot of patches by Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>:
    + 001_etc2ps paths
      Correct paths in etc2ps and suggest tetex-base.
    + 005_visible_home_dir_in_config
      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser.
    + 007_logcheck
      Support for the logcheck log file checking package.
    + 011_avoid_symlinks_and_force_using_autoconf_2.50
      Partly applied: Patch configure.in so that the use of autoconf 2.50
      is forced. (Debian autoconf hack workaround.)
    + 012_netatalk.conf
      Improved init script. Also, make use of netatalk.conf again.
      I patched the patch so that netatalk.conf is placed in /etc/default.
    + 015_recommend_lsof_(for_macusers)_and_suggest_quota
      Recommend lsof and suggest quota.
    + 021_enable_ssl_and_cracklib_and_correct_pam_paths
      Partly applied: Enable cracklib support.
  * Fixed paths in add_netatalk_printer.
  * Removed lp2pap.sh since it's of no use on Debian systems.
  * Removed test_parse_mtab and afpd-mtab.pl because we are not using
    the mtab DID scheme.
  * Comparison operator is '=', not '==' in the 'test' command. Fixed
    my patch.
  * Removed netatalk.conf.5 as well, since we don't install netatalk.conf
    anymore.
  * Removed superfluous file /etc/netatalk/netatalk.pamd.
  * Moved all *.la and *.a files to netatalk-dev. Added appropriate
    conflicts and replaces.
  * debian/rules: Do not copy files to package build directories instead of
    removing them afterwards.

netatalk (1.5pre7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Most patches were applied upstream.
  * This release uses libtool for UAM stuff. Also, the correct flag
    for dynamic linking is supplied, so the problems with unresolved
    symbols should be gone now. (Closes: #95399)
  * Non-DSFG free code was removed. Copyright notice was changed accordingly.
  * Use ./configure --sysconfdir instead of --with-config-dir.
  * Upstream package does now install PAM file in the correct directory.
    Removed rule, correcting this from Debian rules file.
  * Added man pages for netatalk-config(1) and timelord(8). (Upstream
    does now also include a man page for timeout(1), but since we're not
    distributing it anymore, we don't care.)
  * Some doc files were removed, others were added.
  * Use debhelper compatibility level 3 and performed general packaging
    cleanups at the same time.
  * Standards-Version 3.5.6.0. No changes needed.
  * Netatalk is now GPL'ed. Added a note stating that to copyright.
    Also, we can't link against libssl anymore. Removed SSL stuff.
    I had to patch configure.in to do that.
  * Removed emacs stuff from changelog.
  * Applied a patch to getiface.c for a problem that could lead to
    segfaults. Thanks to Kai Henningsen <kaih@khms.westfalen.de>
    for actually being affected by this bug, and - more importantly -
    finding the problem. (Closes: #109310)

netatalk (1.5pre6-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated config.{sub,guess} again, just to make sure ...
  * Depend on the timeout package from tct. Also, don't distribute
    /usr/bin/timeout and remove the timeout(1) link to undocumented(7).
    Make preparations to remove the proper timeout(1) man page that will
    get distributed with netatalk 1.5pre7.

  * Distribute missing pagecount.ps. (Closes: #95117)
  * Compile timelord.

netatalk (1.4b2+asun2.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libatalk1 and libatalk1-dev (I think it is a mistake to "fork" a
    shared version of a library in Debian, if the library is static upstream
    then upstream isn't gonna be careful with the ABI).

  * New "upstream" release.
  * This does add new features, however, it also fixes at
    least one nasty bug (Bug#13973).
  * Applied patch which adds a command-line option to disable
    CR/LF translation (thanks to Davide Welton and Jon Nelson).
    (Note to release manager: this patch is applied so this
     package has the exact functionality of netatalk-asun)
  * Renamed libatalk-dev to libatalk1-dev.
  * Symlinked /usr/man/man1/nbpunrgstr.1.gz to /usr/man/man1/nbprgstr.1.gz
    to keep lintian happy.
  * Changed the "lock directory" to /var/run and the names of the "lock files" to <foo>.pid,
    since what the source calls locks are really the same as the .pid files other daemons
    put in /var/run.
  * This package provides all the functionality of netatalk-asun, and
    it will replace netatalk-asun in the distribution.

netatalk (1.4b2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PAM support.
  * Split into libatalk, libatalk-dev, and netatalk.
  * Added patch from Randy Gobbel <gobbel@cogsci.ucsd.edu> to allow case
    translation to be specified at config-time rather than compile time.
    Note that configuration files that make use of this feature may not
    work with other releases of netatalk, and that this feature may be
    removed in the future if UMich rejects the patch or implements it
    differently.
  * Startup messages now conform to 'Standard for Console Messages' (fixes

netatalk (1.4b2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to upstream version 1.4b2.
  * Added preliminary PAM support (currently disabled).
  * Made /etc/init.d/netatalk a conffile.
  * Changed /etc/init.d/netatalk to complete only once appletalk services
    are running.  Configurating an Appletalk interface can take many (> 15)
    seconds, so the previous version would fork a process to configure the
    interface and then start up the other Appletalk services.  Although
    possibly controversial, this change is necessary so that packages like
    ppr can be ensured that netatalk will be started before they run
    without undue complication.
