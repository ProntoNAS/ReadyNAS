laz notes on various ways to view the stuff (pop-up, inpage, etc.)

sub modinfo: this code does not work. modinfo needs arguments.

bsd.pl: sub lastcomm, don't run lastcomm on someone elses database,
unless you know it is the same system type... same problem as with
dumping someone elses last database.

Design notes - safe commands, log all commands, no shell used...

does "grave-robber -m <dirname>" do a stat on <dirname>?

test mactime -d & -B flags

last -f [/var/adm/wtmp]?
