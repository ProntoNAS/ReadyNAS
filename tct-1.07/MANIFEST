This is a list of the contents in The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) package and
covers some basic functionality.


Extra important files:
----------------------

LICENSE && COPYRIGHT - these two files cover everything that is not 
	covered by individual copyrights in each package.  Most of the
	C code is covered by the former; most perl code is covered by
	the latter.  See individual files to see what is covered by
	what - if it doesn't explicitly state anything the latter applies.

README.FIRST - the first thing you should read in all this; a short
	explanation of what this is all about.

README - a general overview of the package, how to use it, etc.

INSTALL - what you need to use TCT as well as how to install it.

MANIFEST - this file!  ;-)

Makefile - the "make" command *must* be run to use TCT; this is the file
	that controls the installation of the program.

quickstart - for those who hate documentation *and* know what they are doing.

help-when-broken-into - a small tutorial for neophytes who just got broken
	into and grabbed this package.

BUGS - any outstanding, known bugs


Directories:
------------

Date - the perl date library 
bin - where all the executable programs live.
conf - configuration files
docs - overall documentation for the package
etc - additional config files that are never changed
extras - extra toys, tools, and utilities - see the README in that subdir
lazarus - the data reconstruction program (see additional documentation there).
lib - perl & C libraries
man - man pages individual programs
src - all the C code lives here [several subdirectories, should be obvious]

Individual programs (mostly in the "bin" directory); many only
created after typing "make":
---------------------------------------------------------------

reconfig - run this first, it tries to find all the appropriate files
	on the current system (automatically run when you type "make"
	after unpacking the source code).

file - attempts to determine the content type of a file (originally
	from the FreeBSD distribution, ported by wietse).
grave-robber - the main data gathering program.
icat - copies (cat(1)) a file by inode number.
ils - list file system inode information.
lastcomm - a portable lastcomm command (originally from the FreeBSD
	distribution, ported by wietse).
mactime - the M, A, C time file system reporter.
major_minor - used internally by the TCT, it emits perl code
md5 - the RSA MD5 digital signature tool.
pcat - copies the address space of a running process.
strip_tct_home - used internally by the TCT, it strips out a variable
	from various files
unrm - uncovers unallocated blocks from a raw Unix file system.

Miscellaneous files & information:
----------------------------------

OS-NOTES - some small notes on individual operating systems and their quirks.

TODO - a list of enhancements and improvements we're working on or think
	should be done.

additional-resources - other tools, etc. that might be useful.

bibliography - some of the resources, electronic and physical, that we 
	used and swear by, rather than at.
