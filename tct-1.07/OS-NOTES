Various miscellaneous notes by OS
----------------------------------

Sun -

	Sun has changed their way of mucking around with dead systems;
	in the old days you would use ps, netstat, and other commands
	with the core/system files and you could get good results.
	The crash(1M) command took over some of these duties around
	solaris 2.5/2.5.1.  Solaris 8 introduced mdb, an extensible adb 
	compatible debugger.
