Installation instructions and requirements for The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT).

   ***                                                            ***
   ***                                                            ***
   *** TCT requires that the system have a working C compiler and ***
   *** perl, version 5.0004 or later.  The lsof utility is HIGHLY ***
   *** recommended.                                               ***
   ***                                                            ***
   ***                                                            ***

TCT is meant to be run from its own directory - efforts to move individual
files to various locations (/usr/local/bin or wherever) is left as an
excercise for the reader. If you do so, be aware that the file(1)
command has a non-standard path for the magic file wired into it.

Installation is therefore simple - find a location that has room -
preferably *lots* of room, as several of the tools in the toolkit can
generate *lots* of data (especially unrm/lazarus) and untar the thing.

   ***                                                              ***
   ***                                                              ***
   ***  At least several megabytes of storage is required for the   ***
   *** TCT output, but it can easily consume 100 MB or more.  And   ***
   *** the unrm tool (which is not run from the main program, for   ***
   *** what will be obvious reasons) can consume *twice* as much    ***
   *** space as the unallocated (or free) space on a disk - easily  ***
   *** many *GB*'s (or more!) of data.  Be cautious and don't run   ***
   *** out of space!  It will help to practice on various systems   ***
   *** to get a feel for how much room it will consume.             ***
   ***                                                              ***
   ***                                                              ***


Currently the following OS's are at least semi-supported (e.g. the more 
recent versions (as of this writing, June 24, 2000) of the OS should work):

  FreeBSD 2-4.*
  OpenBSD 2.*
   BSD/OS 2-4.*
    SunOS 4-5.*
    Linux 2.*


The Actual Install
-------------------

The Makefile should automatically do the right thing.  Simply type:

	make

Don't be too alarmed by any files that it says it can't find - unless 
it's something major, like perl (!) - it is attempting to find everything 
that it could possibly use for any operating system the package supports.

At this point, if all has gone well, you can start using the toolkit.
Most of the useful tools/binaries are in the "bin" directory.  You might
read the "README" file in the "doc" directory for more instructions
on how to use this toolkit (or the "quick-start" mini doc for starting
very quickly).  Individual utilities all have manual pages in appropriate
subdirectories located within the "man" directory.

Additional commands, not yet used by the toolkit software, can be
found in the "extras" directory. Manual pages are in the directories
with the source code of the respective commands.


Reinstalling
-------------

For security reasons TCT uses full path names.  If you're reinstalling
it or have moved it around you'll want to run the "reconfig" program again;
simply type:

	perl reconfig

And it should do the rest.  If you're going to a completely different
architecture you'll also want to do a "make clean" (removes all binaries)
or "make tidy" (removes binaries *AND* data files).
