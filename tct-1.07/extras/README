This directory contains some additional programs we've been using in testing
and analysis that you may or may not find useful.  The programs might
be worked on, expanded, or included in a more active role in future packages.


bdf	-  Basic Dependency Finder.  This rather odd thing goes through 
	   text & binaries files recursively, looking for executables and 
	   files of potential interest.  Try it on /etc/rc files and
	   whatnot for a laugh.  Look at options and such in the comments
	   at the top of the code.

ils2mac -  This converts the output of the ils command to a "body" file
	   database that mactime can use.  This is how we get mactimes
	   for removed files.  You can concatenate it to a normal body
	   file and look at the combined results for better understanding
	   of system behavior.

realpath - uses the realpath library to get the real path of a file
	   (resolves links, etc.)

findkey	-  Search data for cryptographic keys.

entropy	-  Compute data entropy a la Shannon.
