Welcome!  All this - and the most current version of lazarus - is kept at:

	http://www.fish.com/security/tct.html

Files included in this subdirectory include:

	Makefile			- makes all the C progs

	src/file			- a port of file(1)

	src/fstools			- various filesystem tools;
					  "unrm" is the main thing of
					  interest here for this part
					  of the project.

	postprocessing			- tools that can be used after
					  lazarus has processed the data.

	lazarus.damn-the-torpedos	- if you don't want to read docs...

	lazarus				- the lazarus program source
	lazarus.cf			- lazarus conf file

	paths.pl			- where a few commands are for lazarus

	TODO				- brief list of some stuff to do

An overview of lazarus - lazarus.README - can be found in the "docs" 
subdirectory of the main TCT directory and in the lazarus man page (in the
"man" subdirectory of the TCT).


You should be able to type "make" and the programs should compile.  After
that, either read "lazarus.txt" or, if impatient/don't want to read docs,
"lazarus.damn-the-torpedos" to get started.


Any questions should go to tct@fish.com.  This will go to both wietse
and myself.  Individual mail to us can be sent to zen@fish.com or 
wietse@porcupine.org.

	dan & wietse
