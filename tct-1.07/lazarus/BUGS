It's not clear if this is a bug or a feature; if you run lazarus on
a raw file system or file with the HTML option (-h), you might get an 
unexpected set of output files.

For instance:

	# lazarus -h /dev/rsd4a

Will create block & www directories within the same current working directory
of lazarus, but the 3 frame files created to aid viewing will be created as:

	/dev/rsd4a.frame.html
	/dev/rsd4a.menu.html
	/dev/rsd4a.html

This is probably not what you want, however, it's not clear if the files
should be in the current directory or not, because if you use the
-b and -w options you might expect them to follow one of those as well -
perhaps it should follow the -w option location.

Anyway, for now you can simply create a symlink in your current directory
and it'll work as expected.  I'll fix this soon.
