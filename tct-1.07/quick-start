(You'll need perl 5.004 - lsof is *highly* suggested.)

Do the following to quickly fire up TCT:

	1) type "make"

(Ignore notes about not finding files and moving on, unless it explicitly
keels over and dies).

And, as either as root or as an unprivileged user (root will allow you
to capture files and process information that a normal user won't, but
for testing purposes it's fine to run it from a non-system account):

	2) type "bin/grave-robber -v directory"

(Where "directory" is some dir you want to try it out on.  Try /etc or
something for starters; typically you'll want to use "/" in a real
investigation.  Beware of NFS dirs, etc., as the grave-robber will
merrily suck up everything in its path.)

***	The -p flag is a flag to capture additional process data - if 
***	you're feeling brave, try it!  (You'll collect more data, but 
***	could crash your system, especially if you're running a windows
***	system at the time).

If you're doing a security investigation you should disconnect the system
from the network - if at all possible - before starting (while this will
make DNS resolution difficult, it is still advised).  After finishing
the run you should also remove all your output from the system so it
cannot be seen or modified by others.

Finally, there are two log files of general interest that are generated
by the grave-robber - "coroner.log" and "error.log".  The first logs
all the shell commands and when they were executed, the error log lists
all the output going to stderr, which is often, but not always, of some
interest.
