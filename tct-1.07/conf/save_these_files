#   Some files to copy into the vault for safekeeping... note - won't 
# suck up dirs, only files, so:
#
# 	/etc/*
#
# wouldn't get stuff in the /etc/postfix subdirectory, for instance,
# you'd need:
#
#	/etc/*/*
#
# Also, uses *SHELL* RE, *NOT* perl regexp, so don't try "/etc/.*"!
#
#

# Everything should be prepended with $CORPSE so that the -c option
# will work - it gets ignored if the -c option isn't there, so "/bin"
# is the same as "$CORPSE/bin", unless the -c is used in the grave-robber.

# just in case you're foolish enough to comment out /etc/*, need these at
# least!!!  No harm in dups.
