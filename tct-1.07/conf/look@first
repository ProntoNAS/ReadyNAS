#  These are dirs containing tools & files we want to investigate first,
# so we stat/whatever them first, and then we can fuck with them without 
# worrying about destroying forensic evidence.
#
#  We automatically go through the $PATH variable of the user running
# the program, so mostly this is for config and log dirs (/etc, /var/log,
# etc.)
#
#
#  The current dir is automatically looked at first
#
#  Then in order, the dirs in this file
#
# Everything should be prepended with $CORPSE so that the -c option
# will work - it gets ignored if the -c option isn't there, so "/bin"
# is the same as "$CORPSE/bin", unless the -c is used in the grave-robber
#

/etc
/bin
/sbin
/dev

# /sbin/bin
# /usr/bin
# /usr/ucb
# /usr/local/bin
# /var/adm
# /var/log
