Mon May 14 13:11:54 EDT 2001

o	Patch 06 broke lib/pass.cache.pl, which broke mactime.

o	Patch 06 did not update the patchlevel file.

Fri Mar 16 14:25:11 EST 2001

o	Fixed rpm root directory when running on a corpse.
	Marco Walter (SUN).

o	Fixed file(1) output parsing problem with multiple :
	characters.  Marco Walter (SUN)

Thu Feb 22 11:16:40 EST 2001

o	Patch by Brian Carrier (Purdue) so that fs_read_random()
	properly maintains file offset information.

Thu Feb  8 10:40:02 EST 2001

o	grave-robber dies silently when no group file is found.
	This bites when examining a partial machine corpse
	(bin/grave-robber). Klaus-Peter Kossakowski.

o	The "do first looks" code did not relocate to $TCT_HOME
	(lib/tree.pl). Klaus-Peter Kossakowski.

Tue Jan 23 18:44:36 EST 2001

o       The grave-robber did not correctly handle multi-line df
	output records (ps_spy.pl, suck_free_inodes.pl).

o       The grave-robber mounted corpse inode scan looked only at
	the corpse's "root" file system (suck_free_inodes.pl).

Mon Jan 22 11:23:32 EST 2001

o       grave-robber enabled the default -lPO flags when -c was
	specified, causing the program to gripe and exit.
	
Tue Sep 26 10:55:24 EDT 2000

o       Fixed a bug in fs_read_block() that caused icat etc. to
	remember the wrong file seek position, so that icat etc.
	would call lseek() too often. The other possibility, not
	calling lseek() when it should be called, did not happen
	due to an implementation artefact of the TCT utilities.
	Reported by Brian Carrier, Purdue University.

	Updated help-recovering-file document by Dan.

Sat Aug 12 10:51:16 EDT 2000

o       Added -V option to direct icat/ils/unrm for verbose output
	to stdout.  The -v option now sends verbose logging to stderr.

Tue Aug  8 11:46:19 PDT 2000

o	created "help-recovering-file", added note to README.FIRST

Sat Aug  5 11:34:26 PDT 2000

o	mactime time range repaired, fixed docs, -l option slightly
	fixed... perhaps deprecation in the future?

Fri Aug  4 20:06:15 EDT 2000

o	ils and ils2mac now include device names for more
	readable mactime reports of dead inodes.

o	mactime could not run with current working directory
	different from $TCT_HOME.

o	mactime -d could destroy an existing $DATA/body file.

o	mactime -d turned on verbosity, instead of letting -v do that.

o	mactime -s (suid) flag used an obsolete method of getting data.

o	ils2mac broke because perl split() can't see the difference
	between empty last fields and missing last fields.

o	mactime mistakenly skipped files with all-zero time stamps.

o	ils2mac now emits ls -l like info for mactime compatibility.

Tue Aug  1 13:50:20 PDT 2000

o	Prepend our directory list to @INC rather than clobbering it.

Mon Jul 31 17:37:35 PDT 2000

o	a few minor changes in README.FIRST; prettied up the start a bit

Sun Jul 30 16:38:10 PDT 2000

o	removed junk file from laz subdir

o	edited/spell checked extras/README, man/man1/grave-robber.1, 
	lazarus/{BUGS,TODO}

Sun Jul 30 16:04:39 PDT 2000

o	added /dev to look@first file

o	minor changes to "rip-mail" & "rip-mail.README" in the
	"lazarus/post-processing" dir

Sun Jul 30 10:40:12 EDT 2000

o	BSD/OS mkdir refuses pathnames ending in /.

o	ps_spy.pl clobbered the initial date record in the lsof
	and ps output files.

o	ps_spy.pl signed the ps and lsof output files too early so
	that the checksum did not match the inal content.

Sat Jul 29 17:11:12 PDT 2000

o	grave robber man page, comments fixed

o	lazarus.readme slightly changed

o	help-when-broken... doc finished

o	changed some todo* notes

Sat Jul 29 13:13:41 EDT 2000

o	Made icat executable grabbing work again for non-proc systems.

o	Sync the file system so that the scan for open unlinked
	files doesn't copy the files that it just created (FreeBSD
	4.0 needs this).

o	Jay! Ported grave-robber to Perl 5.000 (disallows () after
	sub foo declaration).  Perl 5.000 misses files needed by
	mactime, but at least we can collect data for off-line
	analysis.

o	vault_cp.pl should not chdir() twice to install a symlink.

Fri Jul 28 21:26:34 PDT 2000

o	made the search for core/kernel files much better, fixed bug
	in solaris.pl, sunos.pl, and bsd.pl WRT this.

o	put back in $copy_threshold into grave-robber.cf, vault_cp.pl.
	default, 0, means ignore limit; vault_cp only copies files now
	(doublechecked)

o	changed grave-robber.README

o	put back in changes that were lost in README.FIRST

o	made slight changes to the main README

o	added the -O option (save files that are open but have been deleted)
	to the -f (fast/quick) option

Thu Jul 27 23:38:29 PDT 2000

o	vault_cp.pl makes relative links in the data subsystem now

o	relative paths are now used in MD5_all

o	located and removed system("") (!) calls by chk_binaries, misc.pl,
	they somehow avoided us this long... hopefully the last of the
	system/exec calls

o	fixed symlink bug in trust.pl

Thu Jul 27 14:11:09 EDT 2000

o	grave-robber -P used the wrong file name when signing files
	copied from /proc.

o	grave-robber -t used the wrong source file name when saving
	.rhosts etc. files.

o	grave-robber -P did not fall back from using /proc to using icat.

o	grave-robber -P broke on systems without block devices.

o	pcat memory map and data files now use the same file name syntax.

Thu Jul 27 00:44:08 PDT 2000

o	changed suck_free_inodes.pl to put all the ILS output into seperate
	files

o	added check to gr to ensure that none of the opts that required
	a live system would try to go forward if the corpse opt (-c) was used

o	fixed -F bug in gr... now -M & -F both imply -m

o	fixed bug in trust.pl, now saves all user files it should

o	fixed gr -d bug - now mkdirs, verifies full path

Wed Jul 26 13:24:02 EDT 2000

o	fixed reconfig so it uses -x (execute) instead of -f (exists)
	otherwise it finds /etc/crontab instead of /usr/bin/crontab.

o	added design-notes first version.

o	added tolerance against new lsof -F output fields.

o	added /usr/local/sbin to the reconfig search path so it finds
	FreeBSD lsof.

o	fixed time zone offset formatting error (date.pl).

o	grave-robber -d directory would save everything in /.

o	crontab sniffing with BSD was broken.

o	grave-robber did not capture /etc/crontab when the crontab
	command exists.

Tue Jul 25 22:01:13 PDT 2000

o	added various additional flags to grave-robber

o	made crontab sniffing work with BSD

o	changed timeouts to longer (10/100/1000)

o	killed off $md5 settings in coroner.cf

Tue Jul 25 19:25:05 PDT 2000

o	changes in grave-robber internal structure, added -M flag (md5)

o	wietse's change put in to logger.pl, slight change to bsd.pl
	& grave-robber to use new log function.

o	added args to lastcomm in grave-robber.cf file, changed linux, bsd,
	sunos, solaris files to use it

o	changed dead inode info grabber to not muck with ils output

o	put in timeouts for specific commands in coroner.cf


Mon Jul 24 14:36:55 EDT 2000

o	More lastcomm trouble - the FreeBSD code does not print the
	oldest record, and the time calibration was wrong for
	Solaris <= 2.5 and SunOS 4.

Sun Jul 23 22:13:30 EDT 2000

o	While porting lastcomm to Linux 2.2.* kernels, fixed some
	problems with forgotten decompressions for Solaris/SunOS.

Sun Jul 23 09:41:44 PDT 2000

o	added help-when-broken-into file

Sat Jul 22 19:59:51 EDT 2000

o	zero-effort port to FreeBSD 4.0 and BSD/OS 4.1 (except

	when run on an already clean tree.

o	conf/paths.pl: turned on lastcomm again.

o	lib/logger.pl: changed test file name again.

o	rm-ed unused files: extras/*/error.*

o	fixed bugs in sunos.pl, linux.pl, solaris.pl, & bsd.pl

o	changed reconfig, took out paths.sh, added comments.

o	changed INSTALL & quick-start to reflect make/reconfig changes

Fri Jul 21 19:47:10 EDT 2000
 
o	Ported the changes back to the archaic SunOS 4 platform
	(mostly, missing getopt stuff).
 
o	Updated lastcomm source because Linux has changed again.
 
o	Added timeout support to command.pl. Set the default timeout
	info in conf/coroner.cf. Imported SATAN's timeout utility.
 
Thu Jul 20 11:30:33 EDT 2000
 
o	ostype.pl is now table driven, so that an operating system
	needs to be added only once.
 
Wed Jul 19 10:30:23 EDT 2000

o	fixed grave-robber so that reconfig/strip_tct_home work.

o	ils2mac had hard-coded dependencies on ils output format
	and was terminally broken.

	no longer has hard-coded format dependencies.

o	added "perl reconfig" magic to Makefile.

o	little man page updates to icat, ils, pcat, unrm.

o	"make depend" and "make manpages" should not remove unrelated
	files.

o	added "pwd" command to reconfig/paths.pl, changed realpath 
	to use $PWD

o	changed README to mention extras dir

Tue Jul 18 20:40:53 EDT 2000

o	Dropped in the entropy and findkey tools below "extras", and
	updated the top-level Makefile accordingly.

o	Updated reconfig and strip_tct_home so they fix the "extras"
	utilities (or they would be useless).

Tue Jul 17 17:08:10 PDT 2000

o	Added more resources to bibliography

o	created "extras" directory; tossed bdf, ils2mac & realpath in there.
	Need to put in wietse's entropy/key finding stuff.  README created in
	the subdir that says what everything is.

o	Changed manifest to cover the changes

o	added option to grave-robber; can set TCT_HOME as an environ
	variable, if you really want to do this... changed coroner.cf,
	grave-robber.cf, man page as well

o	many changes to lazarus and docs; primarily adding support for
	the recognition/distinction of small, consecutive binary files

o	fixed man page and code comments for grave-robber, added -l option,
	now dies with exit code if can't open STDERR/STDOUT

o	nuked warning of !dir, added $PATH to stuff we look at first in
	tree.pl

Fri Jul 14 20:25:54 EDT 2000

o	src/file/Makefile wired the wrong magic pathname into the program.

o	lib/command.pl now writes to $logging_handle, and shuts up when
	$logging_handle is undefined.

o	trivial changes to makedefs to account for the ils2mac command.

o	Undo change to logger.pl that prevented stand-alone testing.

o	Added missing $ to the datez.pl time offset calculation code.

o	mactime should set the $running_under_graverobber in order
	to turn off library scaffolding.

Thu Jul 13 12:34:04 PDT 2000

o	moved sniffer regexp recognition to bottom of "if-else" set
	in lazarus to slightly improve perf.

Mon Jul 10 19:52:13 PDT 2000

o	Note in docs - mactime uses secs-till-1970, which breaks if date
	is < 1970

o	changed grave-robber, mactime to use body_init.pl, which makes
	body DB output into real time machine format, also fixed
	suck_free_inodes.pl to do better TM output

o	made ils2mac into a real tool

Mon Jul  3 21:22:59 PDT 2000

o	fixed bug in save_the_files

o	grave-robber -m doesn't do md5's anymore

Fri Jun 30 10:09:44 PDT 2000

o	tracked down some problems with the vault stuff (copying config
	files) - wietse's changes in command.pl again broke some things
	(newline on the end of output)... I think I have the last of 
	those fixed.

Sat Jun 24 17:26:45 PDT 2000

o	doc changes... README.FIRST, quick-start, INSTALL, README,
	grave-robber.README, etc.

	to stdout instead of a file with the -d flag, also mactime.manfile.

Sat Jun 17 09:44:44 PDT 2000

o	fixed man pages and documentation for mactime, grave-robber

Fri Apr  7 19:04:38 PDT 2000

o	many changes to conf files, grave-robber, to make everything
	independent and execute no commands before their time

o	trust.pl, changed a $DATA ==> $TRUST

Wed Mar 29 18:34:14 EST 2000

o	revamped user interfaces for ils icat unrm pcat.

o	"make tidy" did not strip TCT_HOME from bin/*.

o	Nuked backtics from hostname module. All shell escapes should be logged.

o	Nuked the command_to_string("$DATE") from date.pl, which is called
	by coroner.cf.  Instead, use the new localtimez() routine to avoid 
	running an external command.

o	Tried to get the low-level logging to work but coroner.cf file calls
	functions that need logging, so we have a circular dependency.

o	Gave up. The coroner.cf file must be fixed to not call any functions.

Tue Mar 28 17:36 EST 2000

o	change minimum perl from 5.0003 to 5.

o	fixed realpath, made a cwd function

o	removed ()'s from subs in realpath, rawdev, ps_spy, and command.pl

o	fixed solaris.pl - pkgadd needed to look in $CORPSE if looking at
	a dead system

o	more README fixes, additions, etc.

o	added check in coroner.cf to die unless make has been run


Sun Mar 26 17:05:45 EST 2000

o	changed INSTALL doc slightly

Tue Dec  7 02:50:47 PST 1999

o	added ksyms to hosts.pl

o	added pstat -T in hostinfo (not if $dead), nfsstat

o	Added [-c corpse-dir] to grave-robber.  $CORPSE var gets 
	added all over the place, changes made, etc.

o	moved $ETC/magic check into coroner.cf from lazarus.cf

o	added "top" to hostinfo.pl.  Thought about putting it in ps_spy.pl,
	but decided that I'm simply dumping the output to a file for
	the results, not processing, so hostinfo.pl is fine for now.
	Added ftp location to additional resources as well.

o	fixed the -d flag in grave-robber.  Had to shift code around in
	grave-robber, change realpath.pl (it set verbose), coroner.cf,
	and misc.pl.  A mess...

o	mactime.1 & mactime.pl fixed; date/month ==> month/date

o	grave-robber - incorrect error message fixed (was -m & -d instead of
	-m & -f.

o	[should -m run the file gathering stuff?]

o	mv mac.1 to mactime.1

o	clarified INSTALL instructions

o	Changed trust.pl & coroner.cf - @user_trust_files now takes
	wildcards, so we can do $USER/.*history*, etc.

o	made .ssh/ => .ssh* coroner.cf, to get all versions of ssh files

o	Added *history* to coroner.cf's $conf_pattern (to grab in
	filewalk).

o	/tmp and /var/tmp added as files/dirs to grab in save_these_files

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 22:13:55 PDT 1999

o	emergency hack to get lazarus to work (something always breaks...).
	Changed lazarus.cf and coroner.cf.

o	make command not so verbose... if ($verbose) rather than defined.

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 20:51:41 EDT 1999

o	Don't pass zero-length arguments to crontabs that do not

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 19:23:16 EDT 1999

o	Create the user_vault before trying to fill it.

o	Somehow the code for procfs detection didn't make it into
	coroner.cf.

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 15:07:09 PDT 1999

o	added pretty date to cp/proc output files in proc.pl.

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 17:28:42 EDT 1999

o	Fix df being called with void argument.

o	Do not require lib/major_minor.pl, eval bin/major_minor instead.

o	Make sure eval is followed by something or some Perls optimize
	it away.

o	Use raw disk device when grave-robbing with ils/icat, some
	systems return EBUSY when opening the block device.

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 11:43:00 PDT 1999

o	ps_spy - all icat'ing now appends date to filename

o	added major_minor in paths, changed grave-robber to call it,
	added sub in maj_min_walk.pl.

o	maj_min_walk now follows symlinks, also keeps track of types
	of /dev's

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 12:02:01 EDT 1999

o	PERL local variables arent. What a #$#$@^ language (says Wietse).
	This screwed up the pid value when pcatting/icatting a process.

-----------------------------

Mon Sep 27 10:57:22 EDT 1999

o	Do not record bogus major/minor device numbers for regular files.
	The can collide with real devices.

	coroner.cf (including some ssh, pgp, etc.)

o	-f flag added to grave-robber, changed man & docs

o	suck_proc_icat added to grave-robber, also moved around the
	dev walker so that it's before this (required to get maj/min).

o	ps_spy.pl now saves icat'd files

o	icat'd files now go to two places - $DELETED_FILES & $ICAT_OUT

o	maj_min_walk changed to keep global DB of maj/min #s, put in
	scaffolding

-----------------------------

Sat Sep 25 21:48:34 EDT 1999

	to not follow/process symlinks.

-----------------------------

o	coroner.cf - command_to_string fix...

o	$TCT-HOME/test.pl - nuked

o	added/edited text in docs/grave-robber.README & BUGS

o	added $AT to paths.pl

-----------------------------

Sat Sep 25 17:41:31 EDT 1999

o	grave-robber redirects STDIN to /dev/null to make child processes
	more robust. The format command needs this so don't take it away.

o	Added a command_to_string() function for easier `command` emulation.

o	Added execute_command() function to make system() emulation easier.

o	Fixed a couple command strings that weren't broken at whitespace.

-----------------------------

Sat Sep 25 10:12:59 PDT 1999

o	hostinfo.pl - added "format < /dev/null"

o	coroner.cf and various lib files - changed to use command_to_list()

	to safe execs.

o	added domainname to paths.pl

o	added require in coroner.cf

-----------------------------

Fri Sep 24 11:22:53 PDT 1999

o	lib/crunch.pl now uses quotemeta() to protect filenames.
	Seems to kill the shell cruft.

o	added -p option to grave robber (don't suck in pcat stuff);
	also changed corresponding man page.  Changed quick-start
	& README also to discuss this.

o	relative symlink in data dir created in coroner.cf, not absolute.

o	fixed bug - no debug output - in grave-robber & coroner.cf,
	changed man page to grave-robber as well.

o	changed reconfig - nuked 'bin/ostype.pl'

o	removed the "disks.pl" & results.pl files from lib

o	added verbose option (-v) to grave-robber, changed many files
	in lib to add a bit of chattiness.

-----------------------------

Fri Sep 24 14:43:52 EDT 1999
  
o	docs/grave-robber.README: Changed "files that were running
	but deleted when grave-robber ran" to "deleted files that
	were still open or running when the grave robber ran".

-----------------------------

Fri Sep 24 09:42:28 PDT 1999

o	Moved changes to reverse chron order, so that you can instantly
	see what happened last.

o	lib/ps_spy.pl - changed two "&get_date"'s to &get_date()'s.

o	fixed two bugs in lib/date.pl

o	moved ostype.pl to lib (somehow turned up missing), changed 
	grave-robber & trust.pl to reflect this.

	section to docs/grave-robber.README, further explaining the data 
	directory.

o	fixed bug in misc.pl; final MD5 wasn't working.

o	INSTALL changed - now use `pwd` instead of dir

-----------------------------

Fri Sep 24 10:28:40 EDT 1999

o	Makefile: added a command "chmod 700 .". It's a system
	in production that needs to be protected.  Shipping mode
	0700 source code stinks.

o	Polished lastcomm.1, icat.1, unrm.1.

o	Ran "make manpages" because file time stamps were messed up.

o	MANIFEST: Fixed command descriptions of icat, md5, pcat. 

o	README.FIRST: "IBM free source" -> "IBM open source".

o	quick-start: "remove all the output" -> "remove all your output".

o	lazarus.1: A "." represents <insert: unrecognized> binary data.

o	docs/README: "Run it on the root file system if space
	permits" -> "Point it at the root directory if space permits.
	"keep this safely off-line" -> keep the MD5 output off-line".

o	lazarus.README: non-portable tr(1) command: "tr '\0' ''"
	should be "tr -d '\0'".

-----------------------------

Fri Sep 24 00:06:48 PDT 1999

o	TODO list modified with various todo's, TODO.before-release deleted.

o	LICENSE-IBM mv'd to LICENSE, docs changed accordingly.

o	unpacked lastcomm.tar, your changes installed

o	Makefile - deleted the "rm -rf bin" in "make tidy".  Added
	"rm -rf data".  Also chmod 755 to dirs changed to 700.

o	INSTALL & quick-start - mention lsof now as strongly suggested.

o	conf/paths.pl - added find

o	grave-robber - moved &close_config_vault() to the end, added
	comment; now it does an md5 of all data.

o	lib/misc.pl - close_config_vault() now does an md5 on all data
	(after grave-robber run).  docs/README & documents this and 
	advises you to protect it.

o	docs/README & quick-start now advise you to save your resulting 
	data offline.

o	In INSTALL clarified a sentence talking about redhat/linux and
	what we tested on (only redhat).

o	Changed coroner.cf to the full, releasable pattern (to suck up
	files) and to do md5's on all files we lstat.  Also 
	save_these_files & look@first changed to full blown version.

o	&suck_proc uncommented in grave-robber; this is the thing that
	grabs all processes with pcat.  I currently feel that it
	*probably* won't cause problems but might... so I vote to turn 
	it on.  We can easily turn it off for release, of course, just
	my current thought.

o	changed reconfig to read "Hmm" instead of "Yipes" as to less
	alarm people when a non-essential binary is not found ;-)
