Problems & Potential Problems
------------------------------

It's best to have nothing running and do nothing except essentials (if
	that) when you run the grave-robber, since it mucks with 
	processes and stuff.  Save all files before starting it,
	certainly ;-)  (However, if you're doing an investigation,
	don't do anything that would destroy evidence!)

Solaris - there seems to be a bug in the windowing system that can freeze
	up the machine (in solaris 2.7, at least) when pcat captures a 
	process.  Working on tracking this down.

	Use "strings -a" on solaris, not simply "strings", when examining 
	binary files.

suck_proc, which uses pcat to grab all the processes on a system,
	can freeze or kill off a system.  Use the -p flag or run pcat manually
	on selected processes if this happens to you.

If you have an automounter running, going to all the home dirs and
	snarfing up .rhosts and .forward files could be very painful.  Not
	a bug, but you might want to comment out "&grab_user_trust_files();"
	and "&grab_user_time_trust();" from the grave-robber (near the end.)
