.SH NAME
seq \- prints a sequence of numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seq
.I "[OPTION]... [FIRST [STEP]] LAST..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the GNU
.BR seq
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
(but may be used by others), because the original program does not
have a manual page.
Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.
.PP
.B seq
prints a sequence of numbers to standard output.  It prints the numbers from
FIRST to LAST by STEP.  By default, FIRST and STEP are both 1, and each
number is printed on its own line.  All numbers can be reals, not just
integers.
.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see the Info files.
.TP
.B \-f FORMAT, \-\-format=FORMAT
Print all numbers using FORMAT; default `%g'.  FORMAT must contain
exactly one of the standarding float output formats `%e', `%f', or
`%g'.
.TP
.B \-s STRING, \-\-separator=STRING
Separate numbers with STRING; default is a newline.  The output
always terminates with a newline.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-equal\-width
Print all numbers with the same width, by padding with leading
zeroes.  (To have other kinds of padding, use `\-\-format').
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
