This is a test release of this package.

uptime is known to fail on at least one AIX 2.4 system
(it reports it `couldn't get boot time'.)  Suggestions welcome.

For this release, on Irix-6.2, you should be sure to have
ac_max_here_lines=10 in your environment when you invoke configure.
E.g., run configure like this:

  env ac_max_here_lines=10 ./configure

Otherwise, configure will generate a config.status script that
doesn't work properly, due to what I think is a limitation on
the length of a here-script in that implementation of /bin/sh.

I've used test versions of both autoconf and automake to
generate some of the files in this release.  If you modify
files like configure.in, m4/*.m4, aclocal.m4, or any Makefile.am,
then don't be surprised if what gets regenerated no longer works.
Sorry for any inconvenience.  I'll try very hard to be using
publicly available versions of such tools for the next official
release.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother me to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages I get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll
be fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and I didn't apply
it or get back to you, please let me know.

Please send comments and problem reports to meyering@na-net.ornl.gov.
