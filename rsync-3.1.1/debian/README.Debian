rsync for Debian
----------------

To let rsync's init.d script do its work, you need to edit /etc/default/rsync
by hand to set
RSYNC_ENABLE=true

You also need an /etc/rsyncd.conf file as described by the rsyncd.conf
manpage; you can look at /usr/share/doc/rsync/examples/rsyncd.conf as an
example.
