bash (2.05a-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix for causing a segmentation fault when some special shell variables
    are declared as array (therefore urgency high).
  * Apply patch for function prototypes (closes: #124004, #124362).
  * Capitalize `POSIX' in package description (closes: #124439).
  * Add (commented) setting of MANPATH to /etc/skel/.bash_profile
    (closes: #123792).
  * Update builtins(1) (closes: #125673).
  * Taken from the current upstream sources: Make the symlinked directory
    completion behavior introduced in readline-4.2a a user-settable option.
    If `mark-symlinked-directories' is set to `on', the symlinked directory
    completion behavior is disabled, and symlinks that point to directories
    have a slash appended.
  * Add a script for programmable bash completion (version 1.53) from
    http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion. Add commented
    code into /etc/bash.bashrc and (closes: #127645).
  * Install the changelog _and_ the CHANGES file to the doc dir.
  * bash(1): mention quoting when assigning to FIGNORE (closes: #115290).

bash (2.05a-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * This is mainly a bugfix and code cleanup release (as you can see
    from the version number as well). Fixes 64bit issues and index
    overflow errors. Fixes the following Debian reports:
    - Segmentation fault in script from report (closes: #119250).
    - Extensions to the printf command (closes: #72320).
    - Accept an empty list of items in a for loop (as ash does).
      Closes: #91983.
    - A bug that caused redirections with (...) subshells to be performed in
      the wrong order was fixed (closes: #97551).
    - Correctly handle errors from pipelines in andor lists (closes: #102196).
    - Subshells of login shells no longer source ~/.bash_logout when they exit
      (closes: #117701).
    - Don't pass unset shell variable in the environment (closes: #117673).
  * Upstream integrates the following Debian patches:
    - debian/patches/mailcheck.dpatch: check for mail in the maildir format.
    - debian/patches/gnu-source.dpatch: define GNU_SOURCE and include
      strsignal prototype.
    - Don't include -I/usr/include in CFLAGS.
    - debian/patches/print-cmd.dpatch: Fixed an unassigned variable problem
      in the redirection printing code.
    - debian/patches/64bit.dpatch: 64-bit uncleanliness.
  * Unable to reproduce behaviour with beta1, rc1 and final version from
    report (closes: #110483, #110484).
  * Point to the bash-doc package for example startup files (closes: #117642).
  * The man page is precises: comments start with a word beginning with a `#'.
    With '\ #', the doesn't start a word. Closes: #115118.

bash (2.05-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Tighten build dependency (fixes #93509). Only an issue for upgrades
    from bash-2.05-0, therefore urgency=medium.
  * Remove changelog from bash package (also in bash-doc). Reported as
    #93446, #93454, #93455.
  * Fixed in bash-2.04, wrong example in report (#33822).
  * Documented behaviour (ulimit, #72898).
  * Use of redirection for #92324.
  * sed, awk, ... builtins should be provided by the specific package.
    there are other ways to make system scripts faster (ash, perl,
    python, ...) (#61648).
  * Unable to reproduce #34977 submitted for version 2.02.1, bug submitter
    didn't respond to inquiries. Closing ...
  * http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html
    as explanation for C-s behaviour (#68387, not sure why I missed this
    for so long).
  * Part one of the report is Posix.2 behaviour; part 2 (cd-ing relatively
    from a subdirectory into a specified root-level directory) already
    fixed in bash-2.04. #65316.
  * Closing #13645. "The `-l' option should never have been documented, and it
    was a mistake to include it in the first place -- it screws up the grammar.
    Old Bourne shells and test commands had it because there was no other
    way to find the length of a variable's value.  Since bash has
    ${#variable}, there's no need for it.  POSIX.2 says, in the rationale,
    that implementation is irregular and that the shell supports it directly
  * Unable to reproduce #19211 submitted for version 2.01 in current
    versions (2.04, 2.05).
  * Close #2301, safe creation of temp files is documented in bash(1):
    "If the redirection operator is >, and the noclobber option to the set
    builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose
    name results from the expansion of word exists and is a regular file.
    If the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is > and
    the noclobber option to the set builtin command is not enabled, the
    redirection is attempted even if the file named by word exists."
  * Fixed upstream in 2.05: #84743.
  * #76596: Bourne-style shells have always accepted multiple directory name
    arguments to cd.  If the user doesn't like it, have him define a shell
    function (see README.Debian).
  * bash already has enabled the system wide /etc/bash.bashrc (#82117).
  * #88223: Starting bash with --posix, or -o posix, or as `sh', does make
    the entire bash session posix-compliant (with the caveats noted in the
    info manual).  Posix-compliant does not mean `behaves exactly like
    historical versions of sh', nor does it mean `does only what is in
    the standard and nothing more'.

    Posix says nothing about brace expansion, so whether or not bash does
    brace expansion in posix mode has no bearing on posix compliance.

    If you don't want brace expansion, use `set +o braceexpand' or
    `set +B' or start bash with the `+B' option.

  * Lower temporarily severity of #92455, so that this version can move
    to testing. This bug exists in 2.04 as well, so we don't make things
    worse.
  * Apply upstream patch 1.

  * Still in this version: #27090.
  * The `-l' option to test is not included by intent (fixes #13645).

  * Report #26720: perl -e 'print ":;" x 100000' > foo; . ./foo   dumps core.
    Comment from upstream: This is not a bash bug; it is a process resource
    problem.  The default resource limit for stack size is 8M on my version of
    Linux. The call tree created by the parser for the script (100000 calls
    to `:') is 99999 nodes deep, and requires that many recursive calls to the
    command execution routines.  This overflows the stack, and bash segfaults.
    I couldn't reproduce it anywhere but Linux, because the machines I tested
    on all have reasonable default stack sizes.  Raising the limit to 16M is
    sufficient to cause the script to run successfully (I didn't try anything

  * #44015 not a bug. Bash is more liberal than POSIX specifies, but function
    names that are not identifiers is something that may go away in the future.
  * #40242 not a bug: Non-interactive bash shells have always unset PS1,

    upstream author, this feature was removed in bash-2.01.1.  The TAB
    completion only succeeds with globbing characters if there is a single
    completion.  It caused too many problems otherwise.

    bash behavior with respect to the exit status of a pipeline will not
    change.  Changing it as suggested in the discussion of #10494 would render
    bash incompatible with every other shell out there.". Closed these reports.

bash (2.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * New upstream version (closes: #34077, #35642, #46916). For a terse
    description of new features and bug fixes see /usr/share/doc/bash/NEWS.gz.
  * Fixed in upstream release (closes: #14229, #16856, #21363, #22498, #28849,
    #29863, #37971, #38411, #40930, #49702). #37971 either here or in libc6.
    #30803.
  * Separate out documentation and examples to bash-doc package.
  * Do not build shared readline libs from this source. According to the
    upstream author: "It's not appropriate to build shared libraries from
    the readline shipped with bash.  That is designed to be linked directly
    into bash."
  * Link statically with included libreadline. It's intended, because
    potato does not have a libreadline4 yet. Wait for bash-2.04 and
    it's version of libreadline.
  * debian/README.Debian: Sort of FAQ suggested by Guy Maor.
  * debian/copyright: Updated URL.
  * debian/rules: Introduced some variables for packages and directories.
  * debian/control: Updated package names. Add Build-Depends.
  * Point to /usr/doc/share in man pages (rbash.1, builtins.1).
  * Make /usr/doc compatibility links (all but libreadline.postinst, which
    is a C file).
  * debian/patches/conf-update.dpatch: New config files from automake
    (closes #33745).
  * debian/patches/bashbug-editor.dpatch: Use EDITOR variable
    (closes #32576, #32577).
  * debian/etc.profile: Fixed comment that /etc/profile is used for Bourne
    shell and Bourne compatible shells (closes: #3459).
  * debian/patches/tempnam.dpatch: Applied patch from report #35975
    (closes: #35975).
  * bash is not responsible for setting $USER in login shells (closes: #36103).
  * Compile with -DSYS_BASHRC defined. /etc/bash.bashrc is empty by default
    (closes #27055).
  * Fixed with boot-floppies 2.1.3 (closes: #22517).
  * debian/patches/mailcheck.dpatch: Add maildir support. Patch from
    Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> (closes #38794).
  * Patches from NMU are applied (should close #43096).
  * debian/control: Make builtins depend on source version of bash.
  * Build for i386, not i486.
  * Report #28811: "dpkg segfaults trying to install bash. Logging in then
    produces segfault. Still having to run 2.00.0(1)". Not reproducable.
  * Report #15165: "If the last command in the pipeline is killed by a signal,
    bash does not report it even though $? contains the correct value".
    Not reproducable.
  * Report #21645: "If you type `rm */text*<TAB>', previous versions would
    complete text given that they're under the same directory. 2.01.1-1
    doesn't do that anymore.". Not documented anywhere. It seems, this was
    a bug disguised as a feature ;-)
  * Report #36027: "During compiling bash package, files with hardcoded names
    are created in /tmp. In a malicious multi-user environment, this allows
    attacks to the user's files and possibly allow creating trojan packages.
    If the compiling user is root...".
    Submitter cannot be reached. autoconf/automake issues? Reassign to general?
  * Report #16700: "bash terminated when I asked it "mailq -v", while in an
    xterm, with a sysload of approx 1"; not reproducable. Submitter offers
    core file.
  * Report #37637: Not reproduceable (should close #37637).
  * Report #37275: A dpkg error? Or just another reason to completely link
    bash statically?
  * Report #34978, #42858: The prerm now is a binary pragram.
    #34977 as well? #36016 (patch)?
  * Report #43737: Non bug. Behaviour changed from 1.4 to 2.0 (closes: #43737).
  * Report #36459: Non bug (closes #36459).
  * Report #19211: Wanted behaviour?
  * Report #11938: The included patch is applied upstream (closes: #11938).
  * Report #10699, #45656: Todo: See #34717 ...
  * Report #35127: Apply included patch. TODO: test and forward upstream.
  * Report #41082: Obsoleted patches (closes: #35130, #41802).
  * Reports tested and still in this version (should be forwarded ...):
    #2301, #21901, #26619, #26720, #27090, #30460, #33900, #34833,
    #36877
    #38804, #41916 (update docs?),
    #46901, #47990.
  * Report #47849: You *must* reset OPTIND to 1 before reusing getopts.
  * Report #45841: This is a POSIX.2/XPG5 requirement.
  * Report #35979, #45379: set -e works on simple commands only.
    (command) is not a simple command.
  * Report #38244: -x and -v and all of the rest of the options are documented
    in the `set' builtin section.  The OPTIONS section of the man page refers
    to `set'.
  * Report #37654: When in a pipeline, `tty' prints `not a tty'.  This is why
    grep is looking for `not' in file `a'.  Try `w | echo $(tty)'.
  * Report #33822: This is a locale problem.  The de_DE locale gives lower case
    and upper case letters the same collating weight.  POSIX.2 warns that
    range expressions are not portable across locales.
  * Report #28789, #22291: resizing xterm bash doesn' t update window limits.
    Use `shopt -s checkwinsize'. (closes: #28789, #22291).
  * Report #39728: Suggestion to add something to /etc/skel files. A matter
    of taste. Added comments where to find `fancy' startup files.

  * Work needed: #33822 (huh?), #42916 and #44015 (update docs, dashs in
    identifiers).

  * Not tested: (#7047, #10259, #10433, #10494), #14287 (how to test?),
    #14658 (how to test?), #16013, #16797, #20455 (alpha arch), #20821,
    #22632, #26571, #29610, #35994 (powerpc arch),
    #36652, #40242, #47179.

bash (2.02.1-1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Anthonies patch and recompiled as the libc5 version did
    not compile for him (closes: #34717, #43050, #43096, #10699).

    hopefully in time before the dinstall run ;)

bash (2.02.1-1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * Make bash not Pre-Depend on itself. That is, make bash's preinst
    something other than a /bin/sh script; in this case a reasonably
    simple binary.
  * Remove /bin/sh from the .deb, and reinstate it in the postinst if
    it's not already present. Hence make the postinst a /bin/bash script
    instead of a /bin/sh script.
