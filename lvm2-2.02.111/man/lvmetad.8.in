.SH NAME
lvmetad \(em LVM metadata cache daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lvmetad
.RB [ \-l
.RI { all | wire | debug }]
.RB [ \-p
.IR pidfile_path ]
.RB [ \-s
.IR socket_path ]
.RB [ \-f ]

.RB [ \-? ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmetad is a metadata caching daemon for LVM. The daemon receives notifications
from udev rules (which must be installed for LVM to work correctly when lvmetad
is in use). Through these notifications, lvmetad has an up-to-date and
consistent image of the volume groups available in the system.

lvmetad is used by LVM only if it is enabled in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) by specifying the
\fBglobal/use_lvmetad\fP setting. If this is not defined in the LVM configuration
explicitly then default setting is used instead (see the output of
\fBlvm dumpconfig \-\-type default global/use_lvmetad\fP command).
.SH OPTIONS

To run the daemon in a test environment both the pidfile_path and the
socket_path should be changed from the defaults.
.TP
.B \-f
Don't fork, but run in the foreground.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-?
Show help information.
.TP
.IR \fB\-l " {" all | wire | debug }
Select the type of log messages to generate.
Messages are logged by syslog.  
Additionally, when \-f is given they are also sent to standard error.
Since release 2.02.98, there are two classes of messages: wire and debug.
Selecting 'all' supplies both and is equivalent to a comma-separated list
\-l wire,debug.
Prior to release 2.02.98, repeating \-d from 1 to 3 times, viz. \-d, \-dd, \-ddd,
increased the detail of messages.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpidfile_path
Path to the pidfile. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_PID_DIR#/lvmetad.pid) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE\fP.  This file is used to prevent more
than one instance of the daemon running simultaneously.
.TP
.B \-s \fIsocket_path
Path to the socket file. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_RUN_DIR#/lvmetad.socket) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET\fP.  To communicate successfully with lvmetad,
all LVM2 processes should use the same socket path.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version of lvmetad daemon.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE
Path for the pid file.
.TP
.B LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET 
Path for the socket file.
