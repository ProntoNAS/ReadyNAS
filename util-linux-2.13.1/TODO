2.14:
====

- convet po/ files to UTF-8

- add an option to the cal command to control highlight date
  (cal -v YYYY/MM/DD)

- use rpmatch() for all Y/N  ?

- rewrite ipcs to use /proc/sys/kernel rather than unreliable syscalls
  (there are problems with 32bit userspace on 64bit kernel)

- remove support for old system headers (like missing ioctls, ..)

- remove from all places direct calls of ioctl(BLKGETSIZE) and move it
  lib/blkdevsize.c: blkdev_get_size(), blkdev_get_sectors(), blkdev_get_pages()
  (see mkswap.c and fdisk/disksize.c)

- use EXIT_FAILED and EXIT_SUCCESS from stdlib.h for exit() codes

- rewrite the replay script to C to avoid dependence on perl

- add long options to setarch(1)

- cleanup cryptoloop support in losetup -- see debian patches (???)

- "mount -a":

	In the past the right record order could be figured out easily by just
	checking out fstab (if one knew what to look for) but considering the
	fastly increasing number of user space file systems and their usage, with
	their path, library, etc dependencies, it's getting trickier and is a black
	magic for most users because they simply expect drives to be mounted
	independently of their order in fstab.

	One typical, wrongly edited fstab example is:

	  /dev/hda2 /             ext3      defaults  1 1
	  /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   defaults  0 0
	  /dev/hda3 /usr          ext3      defaults  0 0

	The events:

	  mount  ->  /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g  ->
		 ->  resolves to <path1>/ntfs-3g via a symlink ->
		 ->  ntfs-3g requires at least <path2>/libfuse*

	There are many potential solutions. For example installing everything on
	the root file system which may be needed for successful mount. But this
	is not always feasible or practical since we could end up putting almost
	everything on the root file system in the end.

	Another idea is an improved mount strategy:

	  do {
		try to mount all unmounted entries
	  } while (not all mounted && at least one new was successfully mounted)
