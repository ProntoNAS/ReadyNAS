Description: ODBC libraries for UNIX (development files)
 This package contains the development files (headers and libraries) for
 unixODBC, an implementation of the Open DataBase Connectivity interface
 for Unix systems.  You should not need to install this package unless
 you intend to develop C language applications which use ODBC, or to
 compile ODBC-using applications from source.

Description: Graphical tools for ODBC management and browsing
 This package contains three graphical applications for use with
 unixODBC, the Open DataBase Connectivity suite: ODBCConfig, a graphical
 configuration tool for managing database drivers and access to
 individual databases; DataManager, a simple browser and query tool for
 ODBC databases; and odbctest, a tool for testing the ODBC API itself.

Description: Qt-based ODBC configuration library
 This package contains the libodbcinstQ library, a library used by some
 Qt-based GUI configuration tools for managing ODBC drivers and ODBC DSNs.

Conflicts: odbcinst1, odbcinst1debian1
Description: Support library for accessing odbc ini files
 This package contains the libodbcinst library from unixodbc, a library
 used by ODBC drivers for reading their configuration settings from
 /etc/odbc.ini and ~/.odbc.ini.  It is useful to provide this in a
 stand-alone package, so that all ODBC drivers in Debian can use a
 consistent ini library, regardless of whether applications are built
 with iodbc or unixodbc.
 .
 Also contained in this package are the driver setup plugins, which
 describe the features supported by individual ODBC drivers.

Description: Helper program for accessing odbc ini files
 This package contains the odbcinst helper tool, which allows ODBC driver
 packages to install their own driver settings.
