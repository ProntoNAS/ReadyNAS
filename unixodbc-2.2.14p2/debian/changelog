unixodbc (2.2.14p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #433312).
    - Fixes compatibility with Oracle driver.  Closes: #567521.
    - The txt driver has been dropped upstream.
    - The prototype of odbcinst_system_file_path has changed, so time for
      another package rename to odbcinst1debian2.
    - Touch debian/unixodbc.symbols for new interfaces.
  * Drop build-dependencies on flex-old and bison, no longer used.
  * Build-conflict with unixodbc-dev, to work around libtool's persistent
    relinking problems
  * Build-depend on libqt3-compat-headers instead of patching all of the code;
    if libqt3-compat-headers ever goes away, we should just switch to Qt4
    instead.
  * exe/Makefile.am: don't build dltest, this only works if we're using
    the bundled libtool.
  * Port AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG changes over to the current
    _LT_LANG_CXX_CONFIG macro.
  * Build with --without-pth, we want pthreads even if pth is installed in the
    build env.
  * Fix installation of libnn.so at build time, so we don't ship a dangling
    symlink instead.  Closes: #563283.

unixodbc (2.2.11-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix short description of odbcinst1debian1 to not refer to the bits that
    have been moved to odbcinst.
  * Build-depend on libreadline-dev instead of libreadline5-dev, for the
    readline6 transition; doesn't interfere with backports, since
    libreadline5-dev already provided libreadline-dev.  Closes: #553870.
  * Copy in the setup libraries correctly, so we don't wind up with dangling
    symlinks in the package.  Closes: #552161.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 02 Nov 2009 03:59:14 -0800

unixodbc (2.2.11-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split binaries out of odbcinst1debian1 into a new odbcinst package, so
    that we aren't in the situation of trying to clean up config files in
    the purge target of a shared library package.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Sep 2009 13:50:40 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/odbcinst.ini should not be a conffile.  Create it in the postinst
    on upgrade instead if it doesn't exist, and remove in postrm purge.
    (As a side effect, this means we'll need to split this package for
    multiarch, but we already have to do that due to /usr/bin/odbcinst; we
    just need to do it sooner rather than later, to avoid purging config
    files on library purge...)  Closes: #376368.

unixodbc (2.2.11-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put the headers back in unixodbc-dev; those are kind of important.
    Closes: #544438.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 2009 10:20:58 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop dltest from the package description, because it was dropped from the
    package two years ago; thanks to Pete Boyd for pointing this out.
    Closes: #448610.
  * Build-Depend on libltdl-dev instead of libltdl3-dev. Closes: #476452.
  * Have unixodbc Suggest: unixodbc-bin, per user request.  Closes: #240035.
  * Suggest tdsodbc, not libct1.
  * Update debhelper compat to 7, adding ${misc:Depends} where needed
  * Drop debian/dh_makeshlibs and the .manifest files in favor of the
    now-standard dpkg-gensymbols .symbols files
  * Rename lintian files to *.lintian-overrides so dh_lintian will take care
    of them
  * Migrate from dh_movefiles to dh_install
  * Switch debian/rules to use dh
  * Clean up debian/copyright to be more accurate (and approximate DEP5)
  * Fix up menu files for the current section names (Apps->Applications;
    Databases->Data Management)
  * Neuter the .la files to not net dependency_libs, so that we can
    eventually get rid of them entirely
  * Drop unused debian/odbcinst_psql.ini file
  * Drop unneeded entries in debian/dirs
  * Set LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,defs in debian/rules, to guard against all undefined
    symbols
  * Fix libodbcinstq1c2's missing dep on libltdl, picked up by the above
    change
  * Fix libodbctxt to not use undefined "stricmp" function
  * Add Homepage field
  * Standards-Version to 3.8.3.

unixodbc (2.2.11-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "libtool loves me, yes I know, because my upstream tells me so"
    release
  * Synchronize the local modifications to AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG,
    introduced in 2.2.11-14, with the current version from the libtool
    package, as used in 2.2.11-15; now we should actually be getting usable
    PIC libraries again and building on all archs, not just hurd.
    Closes: #434203.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jul 2007 23:56:04 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Relibtoolize with newest Debian libtool, to add hurd support.
    Closes: #407114.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jul 2007 12:28:21 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include modified AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG macro in acinclude.m4,
    so that libtool -export-symbols actually works with GNU ld for C++
    libs; and update the symbol manifests to match.
    Closes: #429600, #342084.
  * The libtool version used in the package was updated in the process.
    Closes: #366436.
  * Replace ${Source-Version} with ${binary:Version}.
  * Install lintian overrides for library package names.
  * Set LC_MESSAGES=C explicitly in debian/dh_makeshlibs when calling 
    objdump, so that grep works as intended.  Closes: #407062.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2007 07:24:19 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pull in an ABI change from unixodbc 2.2.12 for 64-bit platforms;
    2.2.12 hasn't been released yet, but if the ABI is going to change 
    we should change it sooner rather than later.
  * Fix a typo in the odbcinst(1) manpage; thanks to Rowan Rodrik van 
    der Molen for catching this.  Closes: #347362.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Apr 2006 00:20:49 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the last traces of libtemplate from unixodbc-dev.
    Closes: #360343.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Apr 2006 18:03:04 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop gtkodbcconfig0 and godbcconfig packages; the godbcconfig interface
    was never very good (compared to the Qt-based tools in unixodbc-bin) and
    doesn't seem to be maintained upstream, the gtkodbcconfig0 package has no
    other reverse-depends and now has an RC rpath bug which it just isn't
    worth trying to fix.  Closes: #136559, #136560, #358142.
  * This means we can drop the build-depends on libgnome-dev, gdk-imlib1-dev,
    and libgtk1.2-dev as well.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Mar 2006 18:07:44 -0800

unixodbc (2.2.11-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * One-line patch to sqltypes.h to define BUILD_REAL_64_BIT_MODE explicitly,
    instead of depending on the caller to define it; this ensures everyone is
    building against the ABI that's actually present in the library, so they
    will at minimum get compiler warnings if they get the prototypes wrong.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2006 02:19:44 -0800

unixodbc (2.2.11-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Go ahead and rebuild against libqt3-mt, since unixodbc-dev is
    currently uninstallable and the current package version won't reach
    testing without rebuilds of some of its reverse-depends.
    Closes: #323358.
  * Rename libodbcinstq1 to libodbcinstq1c2 for the C++ transition.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Sep 2005 03:30:04 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix backslash issue in debian/dh_makeshlibs -- grepping out bogus
    symbols didn't work after all

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jul 2005 10:40:40 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "never-ending fun" release
  * Version two of the library symbol manifest format:
    - include only weak and global symbols in the manifest, not local 
      symbols
    - demangle C++ symbols so that the names are consistent across
    - architectures
    - record the __cxa_pure_virtual symbol, which includes the C++ ABI
      name (for *most* libs)
    - trim the extra symbols that the toolchain is known to add on mips,
      mipsel, powerpc, and hppa.
    The library manifest should now work across all archs for the vast
    majority of libs without the finicky per-arch manifests.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jul 2005 00:07:26 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Per-arch manifests still needed on ia64, due to all libs picking up
    symbols on ia64 even though they don't on any other architecture. :/

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jun 2005 16:05:30 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * And ia64 also needs a per-arch manifest due to compiler-generated
    symbols.
  * Drop libtemplate.so.1 from the unixodbc package, because it's not
    worth all this trouble just for a sample driver that doesn't
    actually do anything.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jun 2005 23:02:15 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * <sigh> once more... powerpc needs per-arch manifests for some
    libraries still, due to compiler-generated symbols.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Jun 2005 17:31:56 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add one final symbol to odbcinst, needed by libodbcinstQ.so.1.
  * Add a per-arch manifest for gtkodbcconfig0 as well on mips/mipsel
    (irritating compiler-provided symbols...), and one for libobcinstq1
    on m68k due to C++ symbol mangling differences
  * Move UnixODBC tools to App/Databases in the Debian menu (from
    Apps/Tools).  Closes: #230682.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Jun 2005 04:19:02 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix library manifest handling to support per-architecture manifest
    files, and deal with differences in the format of objdump -T output
    between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
  * Add ia64, alpha, amd64, mips, and mipsel manifests for specific
    packages, due to architecture differences in the resulting symbol
    tables

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Jun 2005 22:45:18 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #225572)
    - most of the Debian diff merged upstream
    - possible fix for segfault connecting with db2 from perl (closes:
      #268472)
    - libboundparam.so.1 and libodbcextras.so.1 are now dropped from
      the unixodbc package (and upstream); not changing the package
      name, because the one was sample code and the other had a total of
      one exported symbol, named "__extra_func_to_mollify_linker"...
    - odbcinst1 is renamed to odbcinst1debian1: symbols have been
      dropped (and function prototypes changed) without an upstream
      soname change, so we get an ugly package name instead.
    - use --enable-ltdllib now instead of --disable-ltdl-install, since
      upstream appears to have an option now that does what we want
      without hacking configure.in.
  * Switch build-depends from flex to flex-old, and add build-depends on
    bison.
  * Bump build-depends on readline to libreadline5-dev.
  * Add ini* to the list of exported symbols from libodbcinst.so
    (needed by some applications)
  * Drop the obsolete odbcinst1.preinst.
  * Drop the dltest command, which is of limited utility to end users
  * Integrate new isql(1) manpage provided by Kurt Roeckx (closes:
    #236476).
  * Drop headers from unixodbc-dev that we shouldn't be installing;
    upstream has a working install target, so there's no reason to
    overshoot by installing headers manually, and most of the extras
    we were installing weren't usable for anything at all.  This also
    means the Conflicts: with arla-dev can be dropped (closes: #312129).

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Jun 2005 04:16:42 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.4-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag me: conflicts do not write themselves just because
    you add a line to the changelog.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Oct 2004 03:07:52 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.4-10) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for an RC bugfix.
  * Suggest libct1 instead of libct0, since the latter is no more
    (closes: #255534).
  * Conflict with arla-dev, since both provide /usr/include/log.h (at
    least for now). Closes: #274784.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Oct 2004 00:07:04 -0700

unixodbc (2.2.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a pair of undefined symbols in libodbccr.so that would have
    caused linker assertions if this code were ever actually used
    (closes: #215974).

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Jan 2004 16:04:53 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix godbcconfig's section to 'gnome' instead of 'x11'.
  * Upgrade to libtool 1.5, so that we can avoid unnecessary linking of
    indirect dependencies; should address bugs like #210628.  Also
    closes: #211106.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Sep 2003 10:27:00 -0500

unixodbc (2.2.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggest libct1 instead of the defunct libct0.
  * Provide more detail in long package descriptions (closes: #209667,
    #210142).

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Sep 2003 11:48:34 -0500

unixodbc (2.2.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the path passed to dh_shlibdeps, so we actually find our
    libraries.
  * Make sure SQLLEN and SQLULEN are #defines on 64-bit archs as well,
    to make it easier for app build scripts to cope.
  * Make unixodbc-dev depend on libltdl3-dev, now that we're using the
    external libltdl.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Mar 2003 15:01:01 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the libodbctxt.so problem again: exempt it from the dh_movefiles
    list, and also change to using the system libltdl.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 20:35:04 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * remove extra directories from unixodbc binary package
  * set AM_MAINTAINER_MODE for gODBCConfig, overlooked earlier

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Feb 2003 20:00:19 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Address the upload race-condition that had libqt3-headers moving
    at the same time I was preparing an upload depending on it.
  * Add more 64-bit fixes to the code; now builds cleanly on alpha,
    and works with all the drivers that worked before.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Feb 2003 12:59:06 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the build scripts to not depend on <vomit> xmkmf, and to also
    account for changes to <sigh> autoconf's internal macros between
    2.13 and 2.57.
  * While we're at it, add --disable-dependency-tracking to the
    configure options; saves time building given that 'make clean'
    happens with every invocation of dpkg-buildpackage anyway.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Feb 2003 19:37:50 -0600

unixodbc (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #159447).
  * Conflict with old versions of remembrance-agent, which included 
    libtemplate.a (closes: #155101).
  * Remove the alpha-specific build flags, since we're now using gcc 3.2.
  * Move libodbcinstQ.so into its own package, as part of the C++ ABI
    transition (closes: #140733).
  * Fix libgtkodbcconfig so that it's properly linked against libs it
    depends on.  Correspondingly move this helper lib to its own package,
    so no one screams at me for forcing the installation of libesd on
    their servers.
  * shuffle build rules about, to clean up empty dirs in the main
    (unixodbc) package.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Jan 2003 12:36:05 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * "libtool is my shepherd, I shall not want": try (again!) to get
    libtool to behave itself by upgrading to libtool 1.4.2, since it's
    now breaking builds on mips and mipsel that worked before.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Oct 2002 00:13:58 -0500

unixodbc (2.1.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Amend build-deps to point to the new gdk-imlib1-dev package
    (closes: #162562).
  * Polish the package descriptions for accuracy.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Sep 2002 09:14:24 -0500

unixodbc (2.1.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Loosen the relationship between unixodbc-dev and the GUI development
    packages; for the most part, people developing GUIs should be able 
    to figure out for themselves what packages they need, without being 
    strongarmed by dselect.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Mar 2002 10:52:17 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add manpages for odbcinst(1), ODBCConfig, and gODBCConfig.
    Addresses 3 out of 7 lintian errors.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 18:06:07 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoid duplication of effort: we no longer ship the postgres driver,
    but refer to the odbc-postgresql package instead.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2002 21:14:50 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The why-do-we-care-about-the-text-driver-anyway? release.
  * Since libtool is so completely broken in handling libodbctxt.so,
    and since libodbctxt.so is so useless, let's just ignore it.  If it 
    doesn't build, eehhhh. 

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 09:59:55 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch ltmain.sh to handle the 'relinking' issue with libraries
    depending on other libraries in the package. (closes: #130030)
  * Fix use of libodbcinstQ to look for .so.1 instead of .so when 
    dlopening. (closes: #129845)
  * Tweak to the install target (DESTDIR && !sysconfdir)
  * Use GNU-standard arch values when passing to configure.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Jan 2002 11:29:00 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Try to fix the libtool brokenness by using DESTDIR instead of 
    prefix.
  * Make sure Qt support gets built properly on i386 this time
    (closes: #129845)
  * Add library path to dh_shlibdeps invocation, fix for behavior when 
    building on a machine where unixodbc is not already installed.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jan 2002 11:28:00 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Separate odbcinst library into a separate package, so that drivers 
    can depend on just this package instead of on all of unixodbc.
  * Move GUI configure libs and included drivers into subdirectory,
    /usr/lib/odbc/
  * Get rid of static versions of plugins, since nothing should link to 
    them directly.
  * Pave the way for automatic install of postgres, txt, nn drivers.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jan 2002 11:08:00 -0600

unixodbc (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: 116375 (for real this time))
  * Add build-dep for flex, which was accidentally chopped.
  * Build against the multi-threaded version of the Qt library; fixes
    possible build problems if libqt-mt is installed in the build
    environment but libqt-mt-dev is not.  Plus multi-threading is good.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jan 2002 17:01:28 -0600

unixodbc (2.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct spelling of QT to Qt. (closes: 118879)
  * Change priority of unixodbc-dev to match the overrides file.
  * Remove alpha dependency on gcc-3.0, to keep in sync with Qt packages.
  * Add static libs to the -dev package, previously missing.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2001 20:04:34 -0600

unixodbc (2.0.8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * change unixodbc's preinst to only move files out of /etc/unixodbc
    that match the names of known config files.  This addresses problems
    reported when /etc is under control of CVS, and also prevents
    accidental overwriting of existing files in /etc.  (closes: 117873)

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Nov 2001 16:41:00 -0600

unixodbc (2.0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * cosmetic fix to package descriptions (closes: 110196)
