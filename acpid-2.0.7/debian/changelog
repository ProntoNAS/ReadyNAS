acpid (1.0.6-16) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Reword hints in /etc/default/acpid; suggested by Julien Blache.
  * Drop bogus space in modules.dep causing modules without dependencies to
    not be loaded for MODULES="all".
  * Check for read permissions on the defaults file before attempting to
    source it.
  * Don't load any module (MODULES default to empty string) when the default
    file doesn't exist or doesn't specify MODULES.
  * Ignore the result of load_modules.
  * Unset MODPROBE_OPTIONS to work around a bug in initramfs which leaks this
    env var Launchpad #291619 and a bug in modprobe --all --quiet which
    doesn't load all modules and exits with non-zero exit status
    Debian.org #504088; thanks Derrick Karpo and Julien Blache;
    closes: #502704.

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Make sure there is no link created in runlevel 0 and 6 to stop acpid.
  * Remove old links in runlevel 0 and 6, closes: #502613.
  * Comment out MODULES setting in default file, so no module is loaded per
    default.

acpid (1.0.6-14) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Merge support for the "status" action in the acpid init script from the
    Ubuntu package; depend on lsb-base >= 3.2-14.
  * Don't stop acpid in runlevels 0 and 6; from Ubuntu, closes:#495544 
  * Fix support for Ubuntu kernels, stop guessing distro but always try to use
    the ubuntu/acpi module dir if present; this allows using Ubuntu kernels on
    Ubuntu, removes references to Ubuntu from a number of places, and makes
    the script simpler to maintain and more efficient; also matches the
    current Ubuntu script.
  * Cleanup rules; drop DH_VERBOSE.
  * Wrap build-deps and deps in control to get cleaner diffs.
  * Add myself to uploaders.
  * Drop obsolete information from README.Debian.
  * Cleanup the awful init script.
    - Drop support for *.o kernel module files; .ko is used since 2.5 kernels.
    - Greatly simplify computing the list of available acpi modules by parsing
      modules.dep(5) instead of running find and sh multiple times.
    - Rename debian/acpid.init.d to debian/acpid.init to match debhelper's
      documented name (debhelper does pick up .init.d as well, but this is
      undocumented); this also avoid confusing vim which believe it's a D
      file.
    - Don't disable printk when loading ACPI modules; this is not only
      fragile, broken, and intrusive, it's also out of the realm of acpid to
      do.  This snippet:
          [ "$VERBOSE" = "no" ] && echo "0 0 0 0" > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
      can be moved to a more sensible place if it makes sense during boot, but
      I doubt anybody wants that.
    - Fix support for kernels without dynamic module loading; closes: #500659.
  * Use Vcs-* instead of XS-Vcs-* and fix URLs to point at the new git repos;
    closes: #501305.
  * Remove obsolete conffile /etc/logrotate.d/acpid in preinst; thanks to
    James Westby and Ubuntu; LP: #263888. It's interesting to note that this
    caused the new acpid to die once per week when logrotation kicked in.
    Closes: #487815, #491058, #495686
  * Pass -s to dh_* commands in binary-arch.
  * Resume shipping /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh and /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn in
    acpid.  They are also installed in the examples for people who symlink to
    the examples.  Please note that powerbtn.sh disables itself when it
    detects a running power management daemon such as gnome-power-manager or
    kpowersave.
  * Add -D_GNU_SOURCE in Makefile's CFLAGS to fix build with newer libc6 (such
    as 2.8+20080809-1 in experimental or 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu7in Ubuntu
    intrepid) in making "struct ucred" available; see
    http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6545.
