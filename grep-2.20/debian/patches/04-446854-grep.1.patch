 .SH "EXIT STATUS"
-Normally, the exit status is 0 if selected lines are found and 1 otherwise.
-But the exit status is 2 if an error occurred, unless the
-.B \-q
-or
-.B \-\^\-quiet
-or
-.B \-\^\-silent
-option is used and a selected line is found.
-Note, however, that \s-1POSIX\s0 only mandates, for programs such as
-.BR grep ,
-.BR cmp ,
-and
-.BR diff ,
-that the exit status in case of error be greater than 1;
-it is therefore advisable, for the sake of portability,
-to use logic that tests for this general condition
-instead of strict equality with\ 2.
+The exit status is 0 if selected lines are found, and 1 if not found.          
+If an error occurred the exit status is 2.  (Note: POSIX error 
+handling code should check for '2' or greater.)
