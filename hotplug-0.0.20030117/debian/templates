Description: USB keyboard configuration
 If you're booting with a USB keyboard and/or mouse, and want to defend
 against boot failures like missing modules, you should probably use
 static linking for the "hid", "keybdev" (and/or "mousedev"), "input",
 "usbcore", and USB Host Controller modules.

Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you use USB with hotplugging?
 hotplug will load appropriate USB modules automatically if USB device is
 plugged. But, if you are going to use USB but don't want to use USB 
 Hotplugging, answer No, then it sets the followings in 
 /etc/default/hotplug.usb: USBD_ENABLE=false
 You may also prevent all hotplugging with the kernel CONFIG_HOTPLUG option,
 or by putting an empty pathname in /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug.

Template: hotplug/x11_usbmice_hack
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you use USB mouse with X11?
 If you need to use a USB mouse with X11, the X server needs to be able to
 open "/dev/input/mice".  That means you can't hotplug a mouse you plan
 to use with X11; it needs some modules preloaded. If you haven't compiled
 them into your kernel, Answer Yes. (X11_USBMICE_HACK=true)
