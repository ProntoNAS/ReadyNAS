	- call devlabel if it's present; <Gary_Lerhaupt@Dell.com>

Thu Dec 12 2002 dbrownell
	- handle some sysfs timing and sequencing quirks
	- if it's there, sysfs can provide some missing usb data

Mon Dec  2 2002 dbrownell
	- update README
	- updates from suse's patches
	- DEBUG messages should be off by default!
	- clean up "make install"
	- LSB says init scripts in /etc/init.d, and handle 'force-reload'

Fri Nov 29 2002 dbrownell
	- initial scsi.agent for 2.5, modprobes sd_mod or sr_mod

Wed Nov 21 2002 dbrownell
    more updates for 2.5 kernels:
	- handle additional "device mode" usb hotplug, ignoring it for now
	  unless /sys/$DEVPATH/bNumConfigurations says we have choice of
	  configurations (the first one might not be best).
	- handle the improved "interface mode" usb hotplug in 2.5: don't
	  use 'usbmodules', each interface gets its own event report.
	- don't slow down usb hotplug, all hcds now do control queueing.
	- flag usb and pci 'coldplug' cleanups, needed now that we can
	  finally eliminate usbmodules (pcimodules too?)
    other fixes:
	- patch from <Reinhold.May@gmx.de> to address fact that usbmodules
	  can fail where the script parsing works
	- /sbin/hotplug can now save events to a logfile for later use,
	  suitable for debugging, collecting as test data, sending to a
	  daemon, and so on.
	- better fix for 'always run setup scripts', handling cases where
	  modprobe fails until the setup script renumerates to new usb ids.
	- usb.rc, comment the usbdevfs versioning issue (counting files in
	  /proc/bus/usb became fragile recently) and handle some similar
	  config-dependent startup issues

Tue Oct 1 2002 kroah
	- fix for the lack of a drivers file in usbfs in 2.5.  Patch is from

	  searches /etc/hotplug/usb/*.usermap

Wed Sep 19 2001 kroah

	    * modprobe -s (to syslog)
	    * various agent tweaks/fixes

Mon Jun 11 2001  Stephen Williams  <steve@icarus.com>

	- Added the fxload program
	- Rework root makefile and hotplug.spec to install in prefix
	  location without need of spec file for install.

Fri Jun 8 2001  Stephen Williams  <steve@icarus.com>

	  directory, and updated the rpm spec file to match.

Thu Jun 6 2001 kroah
	- added half of Stephen Williams <steve@icarus.com> REMOVER
	  patch. It is up to the install script to create the
	  /var/run/usb directory.  Something like the following would be
	  enough:
	  	mkdir /var/run/usb
		chmod 0700 /var/run/usb

Tue Apr 24 2001 kroah
	- added debian directory filled with things needed to package 
	  the scripts for a debian release.

	  run even without a kernel driver

Fri Mar 30 2001 dbrownell

	  require bash2-isms

	  Tweaked the patch to handle different locations of the
	  'functions' script.
	  
Fri Feb 16 2001 kroah

	  being writable.

Wed Feb 14 2001 kroah
	- 2001_02_14 release

Wed Feb 14 2001	dbrownell
	-  Fixes some problems seen with Redhat 7 systems when the  partial
	   USB setup in /etc/rc.sysinit was not disabled.  The failure mode
	   was that all USB modules got loaded, rather than only modules
	   for the devices that were connected.
 	-  In conjunction with the "usbmodules" and "pcimodules" patches to
	   "usbutils-0.7" and "pciutils-2.1.8", devices that are connected
	   at boot time will also be configured.  If you don't have those
	   utilities, you'll need to plug USB and CardBus devices in after
	   the system is booted, otherwise they can't be properly
	   configured.

Tue Jan 23 2001 kroah
	- 2001_01_23 release
