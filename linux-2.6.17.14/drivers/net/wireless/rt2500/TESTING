Below is information on how you can help out the team with testing
of the rt2500 kernel module.

1. Get the latest source from the CVS tree. Easiest way todo this is to
get the nightly tarball from our website at
        http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/rt2500-cvs-daily.tar.gz

2. Enable module debugging. Todo this run 'make clean' to remove any
compiled objects you have and then run 'make debug'.
This will recompile the Module with debugging turned on and reinstall
it over your existing module. 

3. Install the module as per the INSTALL instructions.
        e.g. make install

4. Ensure there are no compies of the module in memory.
	ifconfig ra0 down
	rmmod rt2500

5. Load the module with full debug enabled using the commands
	modprobe rt2500 debug=1

6. Check the output of your syslog (most likely /var/log/messages).
If you don't see any debug you need to add the following line to
your /etc/syslog.conf and reboot.
        kern.*            /var/log/debug

7. Any bugs/issues you find please report the following information
to the rt2400-devel mailing list
	* Steps to reproduce
	* The whole contents of your debugging output 
	* Your hardware architecture (i.e. x86, AMD64, Sparc)
	* Your kernel version (i.e. 2.4.25 or 2.6.4)
	* Your rt2400 hardware manufacturer and model
	* Anything else you may think will help us resolve the issue
	  (even a patch if you are so inclined)

8. Sign up to the rt2400-devel mailing list and watch out for requests
for testing. Whenever we do major changes to the source and always
just before a release we will call for testing to be done before we
make the general release.


!!!! NOTE !!!!

AS PER STEP 7 ABOVE. Please provide the whole debug output. The last
few lines are hardly any good. If it's large (which it will be) then
GZip it and either upload it somewhere and give it a link or email
it directly to the developer you are working with.

!!!! END NOTE !!!!
