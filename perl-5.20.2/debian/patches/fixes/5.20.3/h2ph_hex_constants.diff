Subject: h2ph: correct handling of hex constants for the preamble

Previously they were treated as identifiers resulting in code
generated like C< &0xFFF >.

We also try to prevent compile-time warnings from large hex integers,
the user isn't responsible for the generated code, so we delay those
warnings to run-time.

(cherry picked from commit 3bea78d24634e630b610f59957e7a019205a67b2)
