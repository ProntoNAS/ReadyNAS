Subject: Point users to Debian packages of deprecated core modules

Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/747628

Several modules are being deprecated with perl 5.20.
To get a clean transition, perl/perl-modules is going to recommend the
separate Debian packages of these for one release cycle so that they will be
pulled in by default on upgrades. This is taking place for perl 5.20/jessie.

However, on systems configured to ignore recommendations the deprecation
warnings will still be useful, so modify them slightly to point to the
separate packages instead.
