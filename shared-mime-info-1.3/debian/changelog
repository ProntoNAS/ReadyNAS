  * [debian/patches/020_gdesklets-mime.patch] Dropped. Upstream pointed out

  * [debian/patches/070_x-crw.patch] Added *.cr2; dropped *.CRW as a case
    insensitive match is done if a case sensitive match yields no results; see
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3143 .
  * Regenerated patches.
