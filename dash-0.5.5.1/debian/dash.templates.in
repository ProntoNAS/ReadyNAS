Template: dash/sh
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Use dash as the default system shell (/bin/sh)?
 The system shell is the default command interpreter for shell scripts.
 .
 Using dash as the system shell will improve the system's overall
 performance. It does not alter the shell presented to interactive
 users.
# _Description: Install dash as /bin/sh?
#  The default /bin/sh shell on Debian and Debian-based systems is bash.
#  .
#  However, since the default shell is required to be POSIX-compliant,
#  any shell that conforms to POSIX, such as dash, can serve as /bin/sh.
#  You may wish to do this because dash is faster and smaller than bash.
