dash (0.5.5.1-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The default system shell (/bin/sh) has been changed to dash for
    new installations.  When upgrading existing installations, the
    system shell will not be changed automatically.
  * One can see what the current default system shell on this machine
    is by running 'readlink /bin/sh'.
  * Change it by running 'dpkg-reconfigure dash'.
