  * New upstream release
  * Build new apr_crypto API (using openssl).
  * Stop repacking the source tarball to remove the MD4/MD5 implementations
    derived from RSA's code. RSA has released a statement that revised the

apr-util (1.3.10+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libdb4.8-dev dependency in libaprutil1-dev. This allows packages
    build-depending on apr-util1 to use a different version of db than
    apr-util.
  * With the libdb build-dependency decoupled from subversion, we can now
    build-depend on libdb-dev instead of libdb4.8-dev. Users of APU_WANT_DB
    in apu_want.h would have to depend on libdb-dev explicitly, but there
    are none outside of apr-util itself. Closes: #621366
  * Add configure support for libdb 5.1.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes)

    during build and is automatically generated
  * switch the libaprutil1-dbg package to the debug section

  * Make dpkg-shlibdeps automatically generate the needed dependencies for
    programs that use apr_ldap_init() or apr_dbd_init().
    For dbd, we will genreate an ORed dependency on all libaprutil1-dbd-*
    packages, using libaprutil1-dbd-mysql as default.

  * Add 'Provides' for the modules that are still included in libaprutil1, but
    will be moved to separate packages with apr-util 1.3.x. This will make
    back-porting packages from lenny+1 to lenny easier.

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

    now linking against the threadsafe version of libmysqlclient. Therefore
    add a conflict with older versions of php5-mysql and with php4-mysql.
  * Rebuild against apr with hardening options: CFLAGS are taken from apr, set
    LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,relro explicitly.
  * Conflict with apache2 << 2.2.8-1, which used an older version of libldap
    and now segfaults with current libaprutil1+libldap.
