.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.I  Zcmp
and
.I zdiff
are used to invoke the
.I cmp
or the
.I diff
program on files compressed via
.IR gzip "."
All options specified are passed directly to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
If only one file is specified, then it is compared to a file with the same name
without the
.I ".gz"
extension. If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary
and fed to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
The exit status from
.I cmp
or
.I diff
is preserved.
.P
When both files must be uncompressed before comparison, the second is
uncompressed to
.IR "/tmp" "."
In all other cases,
.IR "zdiff" " and " "zcmp"
use only a pipe.

.SH BUGS
Messages from the
.I cmp
or
.I diff
programs refer to temporary filenames instead of those specified.
