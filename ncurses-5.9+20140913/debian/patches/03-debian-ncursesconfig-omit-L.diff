Description: Omit -L part from ncurses5{w,}-config output
 "ncurses5-config --libs" includes a "-L" part which is not needed
 since the library is installed in a directory in the default linker
 search path.  The value is also wrong if ncurses-bin is of a
 different architecture than libncurses5-dev.
 .
 Upstream only omits the -L part if $libdir is /usr/lib.  Until there
 is a way to obtain the multiarch path without running
 dpkg-architecture our patch is not upstreamable.
