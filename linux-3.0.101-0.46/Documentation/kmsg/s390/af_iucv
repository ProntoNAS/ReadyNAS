 * Text: "Application %s on z/VM guest %s exceeds message limit\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: application name
 *   @2: z/VM user ID
 * Description:
 * Messages or packets destined for the application have accumulated and
 * reached the maximum value. The default for the message limit is 65535.
 * You can specify a different limit as the value for MSGLIMIT within
 * the IUCV statement of the z/VM virtual machine on which the application
 * runs.
 * User action:
 * Ensure that you do not send data faster than the application retrieves
 * them. Ensure that the message limit on the z/VM guest virtual machine
 * on which the application runs is high enough.

 * Text: "The af_iucv module cannot be loaded without z/VM\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The AF_IUCV protocol connects socket applications running in Linux
 * kernels on different z/VM virtual machines, or it connects a Linux
 * application to another sockets application running in a z/VM virtual
 * machine. On Linux instances that run in environments other than the
 * z/VM hypervisor, the AF_IUCV protocol does not provide any useful
 * function and the corresponding af_iucv module cannot be loaded.
 * User action:
 * Load the af_iucv module only on Linux instances that run as guest
 * operating systems of the z/VM hypervisor. If the module has been
 * compiled into the kernel, ignore this message.
