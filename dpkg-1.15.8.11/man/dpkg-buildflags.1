.TH dpkg\-buildflags 1 "2010-07-29" "Debian Project" "dpkg suite"
.SH NAME
dpkg\-buildflags \- returns build flags to use during package build
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg\-buildflags
.RI [ option "...] " command
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdpkg\-buildflags\fP is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to use during
build of Debian packages.
.
The default flags are defined by the vendor but they can be
extended/overriden in several ways:
.IP 1.
system-wide with \fB/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf\fP;
.IP 2.
for the current user with \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf\fP
where \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP defaults to \fB$HOME/.config\fP;
.IP 3.
temporarily with environment variables (see section \fBENVIRONMENT\fP).
.P
The configuration files can contain two types of directives:
.TP
.BI SET " flag value"
Override the flag named \fIflag\fP to have the value \fIvalue\fP.
.TP
.BI APPEND " flag value"
Extend the flag named \fIflag\fP with the options given in \fIvalue\fP.
A space is prepended to the appended value if the flag's current value is non-empty.
.P
The configuration files can contain comments on lines starting with a hash
(#). Empty lines are also ignored.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BI \-\-list
Print the list of flags supported by the current vendor
(one per line). See the \fBSUPPORTED FLAGS\fP section for more
information about them.
.TP
.BI \-\-export= format
Print to standard output shell (if \fIformat\fP is \fBsh\fP) or make
(if \fIformat\fP is \fBmake\fP) commands that can be used to export
all the compilation flags in the environment. If the \fIformat\fP value is not
given, \fBsh\fP is assumed. Only compilation flags starting with an
upper case character are included, others are assumed to not be suitable
for the environment.
.TP
.BI \-\-get " flag"
Print the value of the flag on standard output. Exits with 0
if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.
.TP
.BI \-\-origin " flag"
Print the origin of the value that is returned by \fB\-\-get\fP. Exits
with 0 if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1. The origin can be one
of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B vendor
the original flag set by the vendor is returned;
.TP
.B system
the flag is set/modified by a system-wide configuration;
.TP
.B user
the flag is set/modified by a user-specific configuration;
.TP
.B env
the flag is set/modified by an environment-specific configuration.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show the usage message and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the version and exit.
.
.SH SUPPORTED FLAGS
.TP
.B CFLAGS
Options for the C compiler. The default value set by the vendor
includes \fI-g\fP and the default optimization level (\fI-O2\fP usually,
or \fI-O0\fP if the \fBDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS\fP environment variable defines
\fInoopt\fP).
.TP
.B CPPFLAGS
Options for the C preprocessor. Default value: empty.
.TP
.B CXXFLAGS
Options for the C++ compiler. Same as \fBCFLAGS\fP.
.TP
.B FFLAGS
Options for the Fortran compiler. Same as \fBCFLAGS\fP.

.B ,
have to be stripped from these options). Default value: empty.

.B /etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf
System wide configuration file.
.TP
.BR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf " or " $HOME/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.BI DEB_ flag _SET
This variable can be used to force the value returned for the given
