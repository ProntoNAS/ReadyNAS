sysklogd (1.4.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use a newer Standards-Version
  * Corrected dependency of sysklogd (closes: Bug#123908)
  * Transfer section/priority into .deb (closes: Bug#123908)
  * Fix typo in syslog.conf(5) (closes: Bug#126899)
  * Added ``-e'' to weekly and daily cron scripts.  Beware, from now on
    they will fail if an error occurs and leave /var/log in an undefined
    state, not signalling syslogd to reopen files as well. (closes: Bug#123281)
  * Added some intelligence into /etc/init.d/sysklogd and klogd so the
    daemons will be restarted when they should only be reloaded but are
    not running.  This could be helpful if after an OOM situation syslogd
    or klogd were killed by init but cron wasn't.  (closes: Bug#126749, Bug#126750)
  * Create /dev/xconsole in init.d script if it doesn't exist.  Hence
    removing this out of the postinst script.  This should help situations
    when devfs is installed and /dev/ get's removed on system boot, thus
    /dev/xconsole gets removed as well. (closes: Bug#106535)
  * Added ftp facility (closes: Bug#100437)
  * Added missing documentation to syslogd-listfiles(8) (fixes: Bug#48326)
  * Added a PATH= statement to all init.d files (closes: Bug#47901)

    syslogd-listfiles
  * Transition to FHS, i.e. /usr/share/doc instead of /usr/doc and
    /usr/share/man instead of /usr/man (closes:  Bug#79250, Bug#80771)

  * Re-Applied patch provided vom Topi Miettinen with regard to the people
    from OpenBSD.  This provides the additional '-a' argument used for
    specifying additional UNIX domain sockets to listen to.  This is been
    used with chroot()'ed named's for example.  An example is described at
    http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html.  This time the patch doesn't
    stall syslogd.  Thanks to Topi Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>

    time.  (opens: Bug#24893)
  * The complete code is still present, search for `Bug#24893'

  * Postinst will create files with correct file modes (closes: Bug#21212)
  * Made /dev/xconsole mode 0640 and root.adm (closes: Bug#11917)
  * Changed priority of exit message from LOG_ERR to LOG_INFO (closes
    Bug#21606)
  * The code now is compilable without SYSLOG_INET again.  Thanks to
    Enrik Berkhan <enrik@rzstud1.akk.org>.
  * Added support for TESTING define which will turn syslogd into
    stdio-mode used for debugging.
  * Reworked the initialization/fork code.  Now the parent
    process activates a signal handler which the daughter process will
    raise if it is initialized.  Only after that one the parent process
    may exit.  Otherwise klogd might try to flush its log cache while
    syslogd can't receive the messages yet. (closes: Bug#24609)
  * Fixed typo in /etc/syslog.conf (closes: Bug#25835)
  * Modified pre- and postinst scripts to set +e before executing external
    scripts.  This is a workaround against a bug in bash (Bug#23857).
    Bash exports the errexit (-e) flag if allexport (-a) has been set. The
    bug occurs even if allexport is being _re_set.  (closes: Bug#26015)
  * Modified ksym::CheckVersion()
    . Use shift to decode the kernel version
    . Compare integers of kernel version
    . extract major.minor.patch from utsname.release via sscanf()
    The reason lays in possible use of kernel flavours which modify
    utsname.release but no the Version_ symbol.  (closes: Bug#20135)
  * Corrected klogd.c in order to support the new address space for late
    2.1 kernels.  Some support for unsigned long in contrary to int was
    missing.  (closes: Bug#23502)
  * Applied patch provided vom Topi Miettinen with regard to the people
    from OpenBSD.  This provides the additional '-a' argument used for
    specifying additional UNIX domain sockets to listen to.  This is been
    used with chroot()'ed named's for example.  An example is described at
    http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html.  Thanks to Topi Miettinen
    <tom@medialab.sonera.net> (closes: Bug#24893)
  * Added support for `ftp' log facility which was introduced by glibc
    version 2.  Thanks to netgod and Flood from #Debian.
  * Code cleanups with regard to bsd -> posix transition and stronger
    security (buffer length checking).  Thanks to Topi Miettinen
    <tom@medialab.sonera.net> (closes: Bug#24894)
    . index() --> strchr()
    . sprintf() --> snprintf()
    . bcopy() --> memcpy()
    . bzero() --> memset()
    . UNAMESZ --> UT_NAMESIZE
    . sys_errlist --> strerror()
  * Added support for setutent()/getutent()/endutend() instead of binary
    reading the UTMP file.  This is the the most portable way.  Thanks to
    Topi Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>.
  * Avoid logging of SIGCHLD when syslogd is in the process of exiting and
    closing its files.  Again thanks to Topi.
  * Added /usr/sbin/syslog-facility, written by Raphaël Hertzog
    <hertzog@debian.org>.  It opens a way for other packages to add and
    remove logfiles/facilities.
  * Modified printline() to support 8bit characters - such as russion
    letters.  Thanks to Vladas Lapinskas <lapinskas@mail.iae.lt>.

Mon Now 25 10:36:01 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

	* modified preinst to work if /etc/init.d/sysklogd doesn't exist
	because of a failure

Mon Sep 10 10:36:01 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

	* ksyms.c: klogd will first look at /System.map (Bug#4403, #4459)

Fri Aug 16 21:36:01 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

Mon Aug  5 22:47:40 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

	* syslogd.c: If you haven't set your domainname, syslogd will dump
	core upon startup.  Fixed.  Thanks to Leeland Lucius
	<llucius@millcomm.com> for reporting and patching it. (Bug#3526)

Fri Jun 14 10:42:26 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

	* ksyms.c: increased the size of vstring, because since Linux
	major versions are decoded with n * 65536 and we now have 2.0, the
	field was too short.

Tue May 28 01:02:01 1996  Martin Schulze  <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>

	* syslogd.c: Corrected behaviour of blocking pipes - i.e. the

	been introduced.

	I have applied the patch from Chris Hanson.

	* I have put another start-stop-daemon call in the startup script
	so the configs are reloaded on startup. This should
	help. (Bug#2552)

	* Sysklogd takes care of this and createst /dev/xconsole if it
	doesn't exist during installation. (Bug#2683)
