  1. Logfiles in syslogd

     As of version 1.3 syslogd doesn't come with a static array of
     logfiles.  Although the logfiles are still organized in an array.
     This array is initialized when the configuration file (default is
     /etc/syslog.conf) is read.  Whenever a new line is read the
     length of the array it prolongued.
