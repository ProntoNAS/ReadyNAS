Additional information about system logging
-------------------------------------------

 . When logging into a fifo syslogd will stop loggin into this
   logfile if no process is reading it and thus the buffer is filled
   up.  Buffer size can be adjusted through the kernel.

 . When using the Perl5 Sys::Syslog module (use Sys::Syslog;) to
   provide logging to your Perl programs, please notice that since it
   will open a UDP connection to the local syslogd you'll need to have
   remote receiption enabled.

   Joey Hess teaches us how to change this behaviour and switch to
   using the Unix domain socket.  After the opening with "use" you
   have to add "Sys::Syslog::setlogsock('unix');".

   The default behaviour might change in future releases of Perl.
