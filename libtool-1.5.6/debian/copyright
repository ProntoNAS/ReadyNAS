Note about libtool-doc:

The GNU info documentation for Libtool is included in the libtool-doc
package and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
The current consensus of debian-legal is that this license is *NOT*
free according to the definition in the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

The Release Manager has decided to postpone this issue until after the
release of sarge, at which point the libtool-doc package will be
moved to the non-free archive.
