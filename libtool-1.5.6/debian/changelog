 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Tue, 26 Oct 2004 10:37:41 +0100

  * Fail earlier on invalid version_type so we output a useful error

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sat,  3 Apr 2004 19:10:11 +0100

libtool (1.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correctly pass CFLAGS to configure.
  * No longer dlopens libraries with RTLD_GLOBAL.  Closes: #195821, #221811.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 28 Mar 2004 20:08:59 +0100

libtool (1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    This largely just included our patches from 1.5, there are a couple
    of additional bug fixes in this release though.
  * Move to a single libtool.info file.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 25 Jan 2004 14:45:02 +0000

libtool (1.5-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Robert Millan <zeratul2@wanadoo.es> to complete
    support for GNU/kNetBSD.  Closes: #224440.
  * Apply keybuk-precious-files.patch (backported from 1.6) to add
    an option to prevent the removal of files from the temporary
    output directory.  Closes: #221420.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 11 Jan 2004 01:33:18 +0000

libtool (1.5-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bring the various copyright files up to par.
  * Apply patch to infer tagged configuration in link mode with all
    compiler arguments available, rather than just the first.
  * Remove the mkdir -p option from when creating a temporary output
    directory to prevent symlink abuse.
  * Generate the info files on build as we need a certain --split-size
    for hysterical raisins.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sat,  3 Jan 2004 14:49:52 +0000

libtool (1.5-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add missing 'continue' line when acting on finding -pthread and friends
    in $deplibs.  This line of code is in all my copies of ltmain, it's in
    my test package of libtool, it's in the upstream CVS where I comitted it,
    it's in the patch file I made to do that and is in the 1.4.3 package that
    used the same patch; but for no apparent reason it vanished from the
    Debian 1.5-6 package!  Closes: #221467.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Tue, 18 Nov 2003 17:08:17 +0000

libtool (1.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Error in the binary targets if a .svn directory exists, to prevent
    me accidentally shipping them in the diff.  To create binary packages
    from the svn source add TEST=yes to the debian/rules line.
    Closes: #219461.
  * Fix libtoolize so the cd command run when AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR is used
    is shown when --dry-run is given.  Closes: #153699.
  * Yet Another(tm) patch to prevent hardcoding of dependency library
    rpaths, replacing the one in 1.5-3.  Any path listed in /etc/ld.so.conf
    is now not rpathed.  This is more palatable upstream.
  * The Ultimate -pthread Patch(tm), the previous change broke placing
    -pthread in libs' $deplibs.  This new patch treats the arguments the
    same for libraries and programs, and even honours them when found
    in dependency_libs but doesn't place them there first.
  * Infer near-default configuration when invoked as 'libtool cc' rather
    than complaining that we can't infer a tag.
  * Fix -static, -prefer-pic and -prefer-non-pic when used with a tagged
    configuration.  Closes: #217834.
  * Synchronise with upstream CVS.  The changes are:
    - MinGW reverted back to an objdump-base test.
    See changelog.gz for more detail.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 16 Nov 2003 15:10:15 +0000

libtool (1.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch to preserve --tag, --debug, --quiet and
    --silent arguments when invoking ourselves to perform
    relink or finish modes.  Closes: #214484.
  * Don't propogate -pthread and friends to dependency_libs, but also
    don't complain when we find it there.  This fixes the recent GNOME
    problems without breaking anything else (I hope).

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed, 29 Oct 2003 17:31:07 +0000

libtool (1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove Build-Depends-Indep placing texi2html and texinfo in
    Build-Depends.  Policy is wrong, the buildds do not ensure these are
    installed for the "build" target of debian/rules.  Closes: #216492.
  * Built with dpkg 1.10.10, the latest version ignores the
    [!hppa !mips !mipsel] clause in Build-Depends.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 19 Oct 2003 16:19:22 +0100

libtool (1.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Synchronise with upstream CVS, in case they decide to skip 1.5.1
    after all and go straight to 1.6.  The changes are:
    - GNU/KNetBSD support added.
    - lt_dlrealloc now part of the libltdl API.  Closes: #120169.
    See changelog.gz for more detail.
  * Run 'make check' after build to make sure it all works.
  * Fix permissions of tests/mdemo2-*.test so "make check" will work.
  * Move rules to create info files and examples .tar.gz files to
    the build target so we don't pollute them with stuff from "make check".
  * Disable demo-nopic test on hppa.
  * Add /usr/local/lib and /usr/X11R6/lib to sys_lib_dlsearch_path_spec.
  * Add gcc-3.3 to the list of packages we maintain the /usr/bin/cc
    alternative for.  Closes: #216349.
  * Remove dead code from libtool.m4.  Closes: #210378.
  * Add the various compiler threading options to dependency_libs, and
    don't barf if we find them.
  * Merge addition of --no-supress option from HEAD.  Closes: #207475.
  * Mention that libtool-doc will become non-free after sarge.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed,  1 Oct 2003 00:27:19 +0100

libtool (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make mdemo2-*.test executable so they don't fail when you go
    "make check"
  * Prevent recursion on missing ltmain.sh by checking ltmain.in
    exists first.  Closes: #164452.
  * Remove build dependency on gcj on hppa, mips and mipsel to
    fix build failure.  Closes: #207923.
  * Remove fallback suggestion of java-compiler, libtool will
    only support gcj for the forseeable future.
  * Place NEWS and ChangeLog files in all packages, also add missing
    ChangeLog.1 file.  Closes: #205458.
  * Always use pass_all on Linux ELF, host_cpu is irrelevant.
    Closes: #208552.
  * Don't pass -nostdlib to gcc when creating an archive so we can
    throw away all the gcc version-specific hardcoding.  Closes: #206356.
  * Ensure STRIP variable is properly quoted.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed, 10 Sep 2003 23:42:48 +0100

libtool (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release of the "multi language" version of GNU Libtool.
    This is a cooler and more froody version of Libtool than 1.4 was
    and not only makes C++ libraries properly but does Fortran77 and
    compiled Java libraries too.  The catch?  It won't work with
    packages still using Autoconf 2.13.  Either upgrade your
    configure.in to Autoconf 2.5x, or install the libtool1.4 package.
    Closes: #190216, #195278, #192918.
