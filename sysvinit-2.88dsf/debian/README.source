This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches, debian/startpar/patches and debian/insserv/patches
and applied during the build.

After installing the quilt package, plenty of documentation and tips
for using it with Debian packaging can be found in /usr/share/doc/quilt/
and quilt(1).
