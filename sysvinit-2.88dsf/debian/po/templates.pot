msgid ""
"The boot system is prepared to migrate to dependency-based sequencing. This "
"is an irreversible step, but one that is recommended: it allows the boot "
"process to be optimized for speed and efficiency, and provides a more "
"resilient framework for development."

"A full rationale is detailed in /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.Debian. If you "
"choose not to migrate now, you can do so later by running \"dpkg-reconfigure "

"If the reported problem is a local modification, it needs to be fixed "
"manually. If it's a bug in the package, it should be reported to the BTS and "
"fixed in the package. See http://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts/"
"DependencyBasedBoot for more information about how to fix the problems "
"preventing migration."
