This package is regenerated from the upstream tarball. The changes made to the
original upstream source are as follows.

* Removal of upstream's "debian" directory.
* Inclusion of GTK-1 autoconf directives.
* Regeneration of build system using autoreconf.

All these changes can be automatically done using the "lame-get-orig-source"
script included in the "debian" directory.
