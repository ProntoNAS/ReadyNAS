AUTHORS of findutils

I do not know the name of the original author of the findutils package.

Here are the names of some authors culled from ChangeLog and
miscellaneous other files.

The locate program and its helper programs are derived (heavily
modified) from James Woods' public domain fast-find code, which is
also distributed with the 4.3BSD find.

Eric B. Decker
David J. MacKenzie
Jim Meyering
Tim Wood
Kevin Dalley <kevind@rahul.net>
Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>
