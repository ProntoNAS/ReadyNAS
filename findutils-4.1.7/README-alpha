This is a test release of GNU findutils.

The latest test release (if any) is available at
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/

I've used test versions of both autoconf and automake to
generate some of the files in this release.  If you modify
files like configure.in, m4/*.m4, aclocal.m4, or any Makefile.am,
then don't be surprised if what gets regenerated no longer works.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
bug-findutils@gnu.org.
