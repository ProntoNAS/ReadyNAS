base-files (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made /usr/share/doc/base-files/remove-base more robust (Closes: #132969).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 16:36:54 +0100

base-files (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Modified postinst to use awk only on upgrades, not in the first install.
    This should help debootstrap (Closes: #130056, #130087).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2002 14:52:34 +0100

base-files (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Restored /usr/doc since it's still required by the system according
    to the doc transition plan.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2002 13:18:12 +0100

base-files (3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed issue, issue.net and debian_version to read "3.0".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 11:22:42 +0100

base-files (2.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/doc.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Nov 2001 13:23:32 +0100

base-files (2.2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created /opt, /etc/opt and /var/opt in the first install.
    They are mentioned in FHS 2.1 and required in FHS 2.2 (Closes: #118505).
  * The copyright file now refers to GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd as appropriate.
  * Updated README.base and postinst to refer to /usr/share/doc.
  * Updated default /etc/adjtime to current millenium.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Nov 2001 17:02:50 +0100

base-files (2.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * GPL is now a symlink to GPL-2, which is the real file.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Sep 2001 13:26:34 +0200

base-files (2.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/info readline/info rluserman/ in /etc/inputrc (Closes: #109110).
  * Updated LGPL-2.1 from ftp.gnu.org to fix line breaks (Closes: #109319).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Aug 2001 17:29:10 +0200

base-files (2.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the first install, populate /usr/local even if it exists.
    Allows /usr/local to be mounted in a separate partition during the
    install process (Closes: #107662).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Aug 2001 19:09:16 +0200

base-files (2.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /var/state and /var/state/misc, added /usr/local/games.
    Reported by Sebastian Riedel.
  * Made /boot mode 755 and owned by root group, since no part of the system
    seems to require special permissions here (Closes: #102080).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Jun 2001 19:45:46 +0200

base-files (2.2.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Creates /etc/motd in the initial install (now made by debootstrap).
    Forgot to do this in 2.2.7. Reported by Matt Kraai (Closes: #101342).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jun 2001 14:38:33 +0200

base-files (2.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made /etc/debian_version a `conffile' (Closes: #81249). To prevent
    unneeded dpkg prompting, this file is overwritten in the preinst
    if upgrading from a base-files release previous to 2.2.6
    (thanks to Joey Hess for suggesting this solution).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 19:33:22 +0100

base-files (2.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The file /etc/motd is no longer a conffile. Instead, it will be updated
    if its md5sum (minus its first two lines) matches the one in a list of
    md5sums of previous Debian releases. This will reduce dpkg prompting
    on upgrades (Closes: #71083).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 20:23:06 +0100

base-files (2.2.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use "testing/unstable" instead of "2.2" for the distribution number.
    It seems everybody prefers to see something else other than "2.2".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Dec 2000 11:41:55 +0100

base-files (2.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified debian_version, issue and issue.net in /etc so that they
    read "2.2" again, since this is the last Debian *stable* release so far.
    Since packages in `unstable' are now automatically moved to `testing',
    a codename in /etc/debian_version will never be "right" for everybody, so
    the only sensible thing to do here is to wait until a new release number
    has been officially decided (Closes: #80784).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Dec 2000 20:40:05 +0100

base-files (2.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored LGPL -> LGPL-2.1 symlink, which was mistakenly removed
    in base-files_2.2.1 (Bug #75949).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Nov 2000 11:21:54 +0100

base-files (2.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /var/lib/misc, since it's required by FHS (Closes: Bug #74317).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:09:48 +0200

base-files (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reduced verbosity, as suggested by Sean Perry (Closes: #70686).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:05:12 +0200

base-files (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release for woody (debian_version, issue and issue.net).
  * /etc/motd now refers to /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.
  * Removed /usr/doc/copyright and /usr/man.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2000 13:20:17 +0200

base-files (2.2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * The recipe in README.base does not work properly because dpkg
    removes the conffiles listed in the status file (Bug #64734).
    So, getting rid of base involves editing the status file.
    To avoid mistakes, a shell script is now provided for that.
    Thanks to Kevin Dalley <kevind@alacosta.org> for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sat, 27 May 2000 20:27:13 +0200

base-files (2.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst and postinst: Do not deal with /dev/pts anymore.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the `frozen' word.
  * Final release for potato (hopefully).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 24 Apr 2000 14:02:44 +0200

base-files (2.1.20) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Made /var/log mode 755 and root.root (Bug #35504).
  * Made /cdrom and /floppy mode 755 and root.root (Bug #25847).
  * Removed /dev/pts. It made the package impossible to upgrade when
    using devfs with Linux 2.4. libc6 is already supposed to deal
    with /dev/pts (Bug #61408).
  * postinst removes base.conffiles as well (otherwise, some files
    like /etc/motd or /root/.bash_profile may disappear).
    Thanks a lot to Mikko Oilinki for the report.
  * Slightly improved README.base.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue,  4 Apr 2000 17:31:01 +0200

base-files (2.1.19) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/dict (Bug #60118).
  * Minimal handling of the old base package (Bug #32888).
  * Removed redundant directive in /etc/inputrc (Bug #59689).
  * Do not reference /usr/share/doc in /etc/motd yet (Bug #61116).

base-files (2.1.18) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle better the /var/spool/mail-being-a-symlink case.
  * Added /dev/pts for UNIX98-style pty handling under Linux.
  * Added a README.FHS.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon,  7 Feb 2000 18:29:00 +0100

base-files (2.1.17) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Some people has /var/spool/mail symlinked to somewhere else.
    For this case, preinst now saves the symlink target before dpkg
    removes it and postinst restores it.
  * Do not fiddle with /usr/local on upgrades. From now on, users
    will be free to remove it if they wish.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sat,  5 Feb 2000 20:10:17 +0100

base-files (2.1.16) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate default info dir file from /usr/share/base-files/info.dir.
  * Do not generate an info dir file if one exists at /usr/share/info.
  * Updated LGPL version 2 from ftp.gnu.org to fix a typo.
  * Mail spool is /var/mail as per FHS (only in new installs).
  * Acknowledge in the copyright file that the GNU Public Licenses are
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri,  4 Feb 2000 14:26:21 +0100

base-files (2.1.15) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed misleading copyright notice in /etc/motd.
  * Distribution set to "2.2" (adding `frozen' in issue and issue.net).
  * Use DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM for the architecture stuff wherever possible.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 28 Jan 2000 14:03:25 +0100

base-files (2.1.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Swap binary-arch and binary-indep targets in debian/rules, since this
    is now Architecture: any. Thanks to Roman Hodek for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Wed, 22 Dec 1999 19:48:24 +0100

base-files (2.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made "Architecture: any" for /etc/motd to be os-dependant.
    [ A binary-all-<os> scheme would simplify this ].
  * Exclude /proc from the .deb under GNU/Hurd (reported by Marcus Brinkmann).
  * Added `set -e' to postinst.
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1 (doc symlinks).
  * Removed obsolete README. If someone still asks about /usr/spool or
    /var/adm then a paragraph could be added to the Debian FAQ.
  * Follow changes suggested by Branden Robinson:
  * Removed remaining bashisms in default /root/.profile and use
    /usr/bin/X11 for X11 binaries.
  * Improved package description.
  * Removed unused bin/edit in the source.
  * Changed root test in /etc/profile to use id -u.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 21 Dec 1999 11:53:35 +0100

base-files (2.1.12) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed Replaces field (reported a zillion times).
  * Updated /etc/profile to use '$ ' as the shell prompt for normal
    users and '# ' for the superuser if $BASH is not set.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 20 Dec 1999 12:56:18 +0100

base-files (2.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /etc/inputrc and /etc/profile from readline and bash,
    as suggested by Matthias Klose.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 17 Dec 1999 14:36:23 +0100

base-files (2.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /var/log/lastlog as root.utmp, mode 664.
  * Removed Linuxisms from /etc/motd.
  * Updated GPL from ftp.gnu.org to be Y2K-compliant.

base-files (2.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the advertising clause from BSD license (Bug #43347).
    Reason: ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change
    Thanks to J.H.M. Dassen for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999 14:04:51 +0200

base-files (2.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added base-passwd (>= 2.0.3.4) to the Depends field.
  * utmp and wtmp are now root.utmp and mode 664 (Bug #41569).
  * Updated extended description regarding the common licenses.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 27 Jul 1999 14:03:23 +0200

base-files (2.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * LGPL is now the Lesser Gnu Public License (Bug #40759).
    For now, the old version is renamed to "LGPL-2".
  * Changed compatibility symlink /usr/doc/copyright/LGPL so that it
    points to the old version.
  * Moved docs to /usr/share/doc/base-files.
  * Changed default /etc/motd so that it refers both to /usr/doc/*/copyright
    and /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 16 Jul 1999 19:45:09 +0200

base-files (2.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst: Do not fiddle with /etc/issue.net anymore.
  * Changed the way /cdrom, /floppy and /initrd are handled.
    These directories will now be created by postinst in the initial install.
    This is a compromise after discussing in debian-policy about Bug #35928.
    It will save people who like them the work of creating them after
    installing a new system, and it will save people who dislike them the
    work of removing them every time base-files is upgraded.
    Since these directories are only a convenience for the user, who
    is free to use them or not, the spirit of FHS is preserved.
  * preinst and postinst: Following the principle of least surprise,
    added code so that existing directories are not removed when upgrading
    this package from previous releases.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 20 Apr 1999 15:39:36 +0200

base-files (2.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

    the utmpd in glibc 2.1 (reported by Joel Klecker).
  * Replaced "Debian Linux" by just "Debian" in the default info dir file.
  * Updated for potato.

base-files (2.1.0) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

base-files (2.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian_version, issue and issue.net: `slink' replaced by `2.1'.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun, 20 Dec 1998 17:40:56 +0100

base-files (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved common licenses to /usr/share/common-licenses.
  * Default dotfiles for root are now installed only the first time.
  * /usr/local and subdirectories are now created mode 2775
    and root.staff, according to policy.
  * Added /usr/local/share.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 26 Oct 1998 19:05:04 +0100

base-files (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * If it does not exist, now a default /root/.profile file is installed,
    not a /root/.bash_profile file, for slightly better POSIX compliance.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun,  6 Sep 1998 16:58:50 +0200

base-files (2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed the "frozen" word from /etc/debian_version.
  * Removed the use of the ROOT variable in preinst and postinst for two
    reasons: a) It is no longer needed, since the base system is built
    by using dpkg's --root=dir option, which works in a chrooted environment;
    and b) Unexpected results would be obtained if user root had actually
    defined a variable named ROOT.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun, 24 May 1998 13:33:25 +0200

base-files (1.9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Default prompt for root is now '\h:\w\$ '.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the "frozen" word.
  * Added a README explaining the /usr/spool symlink removal.
  * nsswitch.conf: Use "compat" instead of "db files" for passwd, group

base-files (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Depends: awk", so that awk is a "virtual essential package".
  * /root/.bash_profile and /root/.bashrc are not `conffiles' anymore.
    Instead, they are created from /root/.bash_profile.dpkg-dist and
    /root/.bashrc.dpkg-dist if they do not exist.
  * Default /root/.bash_profile sources /root/.bashrc.
  * PS1 and umask are now set only once in default /root/.bashrc.
  * Replaced /usr/bin/X11 by /usr/X11R6/bin in root's PATH.
  * Manpage hierarchy is no longer created under /usr/local/man.
  * Added a small comment in /etc/nsswitch.conf saying where
    to find documentation about this file (libc6-doc package).
  * Added some aliases for colorized `ls' commented out in .bashrc, so
    that the user will simply have to uncomment them.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 23 Feb 1998 18:42:28 +0100

base-files (1.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default prompt for root is now PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ ', which may not
    please everybody and/or generate a flame war, but at least is better
    than nothing (previosuly it was PS1='\h\$ ').
  * Added two blank lines to /etc/motd to keep Copyright notice from being
    overwritten by /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh.
  * Removed compatibility symlinks /usr/spool, /usr/tmp, /usr/adm
    and /var/adm. Now is when we have to see if something breaks.
  * Removed /usr/lib/locale. Added /usr/share and /usr/include.

  * Updated GPL and LGPL. FSF's address changed some time ago to:
    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.

  * /etc/debian_version, /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net now read
