target-isns
===========

An iSNS client for the Linux LIO iSCSI target
---------------------------------------------

Target-isns is an Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) client for the
Linux LIO iSCSI target. It allows registering LIO iSCSI targets with
an iSNS server.

The iSNS protocol is specified in
[RFC 4171](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4171) and its purpose is to
make easier to discover, manage, and configure iSCSI devices. With
iSNS, iSCSI targets can be registered with a central iSNS server and
initiators can be configured to discover the targets by asking the
iSNS server.

Build instructions
------------------

Target-isns is written in the C programming language and uses the
CMake build system.

Assuming you are in the project top level directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Target-isns can be built with the clang compiler by setting the CC
variable:

    $ CC=clang cmake ..

Target-isns supports systemd when the `SUPPORT_SYSTEMD` option is set
at build time:

    $ cmake -DSUPPORT_SYSTEMD=ON ..

Configuration
-------------

Edit the configuration file located at `/etc/target-isns.conf` and
adjust the `isns_server` variable to the IP address of your iSNS server:

    isns_server = 192.168.0.1

The iSNS server address can also be passed on the command line with
the `--isns-server` option.
