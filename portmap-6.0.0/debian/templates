Template: portmap/loopback
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should portmap be bound to the loopback address?
 By default, portmap listens to all IP addresses. However, if this
 machine does not provide network RPC services (such as NIS or NFS) to
 remote clients, you can safely bind it to the loopback IP address
 (127.0.0.1).
 .
 This will allow RPC local services (like FAM) to work properly, while
 preventing remote systems from accessing the RPC services.
 .
 This configuration can be changed by editing the OPTIONS line in the
 /etc/default/portmap file and adapting the use of the -i option to
 your needs.
