Overview

   libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX
   daemons. It consists of the following parts:
     * A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization
       procedure of a process
     * A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to
       Syslog or STDERR
     * An API for writing PID files
     * An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with
       select() or poll()
     * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected
       to syslog.

   APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not
   that simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

   libdaemon is currently used by [17]ifplugd, [18]waproamd, [19]ivam2
   and [20]aeswepd.

Status

   Version 0.7 is feature complete.

Documentation

   An extensive API reference is [21]available

Requirements

   libdaemon was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   Jul 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU Autoconf and GNU libtool for source
   code configuration and shared library management.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of libdaemon.

Acknowledgements

   No special acknowledgements at this time, I am sorry.

Download

   The newest release is always available from
   [22]http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/libdaemon/

   Get libdaemon's development sources from the [23]Subversion
   [24]repository ([25]viewcvs):
svn checkout svn://seth.intheinter.net/libdaemon/trunk libdaemon

   You may find an up to date Debian package of libdaemon on the
   [26]Debian package repository.

   If you want to be notified whenever I release a new version of this
   software use the subscription feature of [27]Freshmeat.
