make (3.79.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lintian warnings. 
  * added upstream location to the description.
  * The upstream author has clarified that the behaviour described is not
    a bug, but a consciously chosen tone. Theere is a workaround  to this
    problem: (put the "include b.mak" _inside_ of the a.mak file, so that
    GNU make won't see it until after it includes a.mak, whereupon it will
    also know how to build b.mak).                           closes: Bug#62051

make (3.79.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a build dependency on texinfo, without which info files were not
    being provided on all architectures.                     closes: Bug#124165
  * When make gets ready to build a target, it evaluates all commands
    needed to build that target at once, before the first line is
    invoked. Thus the behaviour displayed is not a bug       closes: Bug#119663
  * All variable and function expansion for targets and prerequisite lists
    occurs when the makefile is read in, well before any sort of pattern
    expansion occurs; so these functions are operating on the static
    string "%", not the string it will expand to after pattern matching.

make (3.79.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. closes: Bug#67862
    * .SECONDARY with no prerequisites now prevents any target from being
       removed because make thinks it's an intermediate file, not just those
       listed in the makefile.
    * New configure option --disable-nsec-timestamps will keep make from
      using sub-second timestamps on systems which support it.  If your
      build process depends on proper timestamp-preserving behavior of tools
      like "cp -p" you might need this option, since "cp -p" (right now)
      doesn't preserve the sub-second portion of the timestamp.

make (3.79-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, adds fixes already present in Debian. This
    closes: Bug#62619
    changes are: 
     * GNU make optionally supports internationalization and locales via
       the GNU gettext (or local gettext if suitable) package.  See the
       ABOUT-NLS file for more information on configuring GNU make for
       NLS.  
     * Previously, GNU make quoted variables such as MAKEFLAGS and
       MAKEOVERRIDES for proper parsing by the shell.  This allowed them to
       be used within make build scripts.  However, using them there is not
       proper behavior: they are meant to be passed to subshells via the
       environment.  Unfortunately the values were not quoted properly to be
       passed through the environment.  This meant that make didn't properly
       pass some types of command line values to submakes.
   
       With this version we change that behavior: now these variables are
       quoted properly for passing through the environment, which is the
       correct way to do it.  If you previously used these variables
       explicitly within a make rule you may need to re-examine your use for
       correctness given this change.     
     * A new psuedo-target .NOTPARALLEL is available.  If defined, the
       current makefile is run serially regardless of the value of -j.
       However, submakes are still eligible for parallel execution.
     * The --debug option has changed: it now allows optional flags
       controlling the amount and type of debugging output.  By default only
       a minimal amount information is generated, displaying the names of
       "normal" targets (not makefiles) were deemed out of date and in need
       of being rebuilt.
     
       Note that the -d option behaves as before: it takes no arguments and
       all debugging information is generated.     
     * The `-p' (print database) output now includes filename and linenumber
       information for variable definitions, to help debugging.
     * The wordlist function no longer reverses its arguments if the "start"
       value is greater than the "end" value.  If that's true, nothing is
       returned.
     * Hartmut Becker provided many updates for the VMS port of GNU make.
       See the readme.vms file for more details.

make (3.77-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Excerpted changes:
    * Implement BSD make's "?=" variable assignment operator.  The variable
      is assigned the specified value only if that variable is not already
      defined.
    * Make defines a new variable, "CURDIR", to contain the current working
      directory (after the -C option, if any, has been processed).
      Modifying this variable has no effect on the operation of make.
    * Make defines a new default RCS rule, for new-style master file
      storage: ``% :: RCS/%'' (note no ``,v'' suffix).
    
      Make defines new default rules for DOS-style C++ file naming
      conventions, with ``.cpp'' suffixes.  All the same rules as for
      ``.cc'' and ``.C'' suffixes are provided, along with LINK.cpp and
      COMPILE.cpp macros (which default to the same value as LINK.cc and
      COMPILE.cc).  Note CPPFLAGS is still C preprocessor flags!  You should
      use CXXFLAGS to change C++ compiler flags.
    * A new feature, "target-specific variable values", has been added.
      This is a large change so please see the appropriate sections of the
      manual for full details.  Briefly, syntax like this:
    
         TARGET: VARIABLE = VALUE
    
      defines VARIABLE as VALUE within the context of TARGET.  This is
      similar to SunOS make's "TARGET := VARIABLE = VALUE" feature.  Note
      that the assignment may be of any type, not just recursive, and that
      the override keyword is available.
    
      COMPATIBILITY: This new syntax means that if you have any rules where
      the first or second dependency has an equal sign (=) in its name,
      you'll have to escape them with a backslash: "foo : bar\=baz".
      Further, if you have any dependencies which already contain "\=",
      you'll have to escape both of them: "foo : bar\\\=baz".
    * A new appendix listing the most common error and warning messages
      generated by GNU make, with some explanation, has been added to the
      GNU make User's Manual.
    * Updates to the GNU make Customs library support (see README.customs).
    * Updates to the Windows 95/NT port from Rob Tulloh (see README.W32),
      and to the DOS port from Eli Zaretski (see README.DOS).

  * With Stellar help from Stephen Zander <srz@mckesson.com>, changed the
    aclocal.m4 file (already present in the upstream sources) to override

    spurious dependency on libelfg0 even if the gremlins cause automake to

make (3.76-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream update. Changes:
       * GNU make now uses automake to control Makefile.in generation.  This
         should make it more consistent with the GNU standards.
       * VPATH functionality has been changed to incorporate the VPATH+ patch,
         previously maintained by Paul Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>.  See the
         manual.
       * Make defines a new variable, `MAKECMDGOALS', to contain the goals that
         were specified on the command line, if any.  Modifying this variable
         has no effect on the operation of make.
       * A new function, `$(wordlist S,E,TEXT)', is available: it returns a
         list of words from number S to number E (inclusive) of TEXT.
       * Instead of an error, detection of future modification times gives a
         warning and continues.  The warning is repeated just before GNU make
         exits, so it is less likely to be lost.
       * Fix the $(basename) and $(suffix) functions so they only operate on
         the last filename, not the entire string:
             Command              Old Result             New Result
             -------              ----------             ----------
           $(basename a.b)        a                      a
           $(basename a.b/c)      a                      a.b/c
           $(suffix a.b)          b                      b
           $(suffix a.b/c)        b/c                    <empty>
       * The $(strip) function now removes newlines as well as TABs and spaces.
       * The $(shell) function now changes CRLF (\r\n) pairs to a space as well
         as newlines (\n).
       * Updates to the Windows 95/NT port from Rob Tulloh (see README.W32).
       * Eli Zaretskii has updated the port to 32-bit protected mode on MSDOS
         and MS-Windows, building with the DJGPP v2 port of GNU C/C++ compiler
         and utilities.  See README.DOS for details, and direct all questions
         concerning this port to Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il> or DJ
         Delorie <dj@delorie.com>.
       * John W. Eaton has updated the VMS port to support libraries and VPATH.
  * Make sure that the manual pages are installed.
