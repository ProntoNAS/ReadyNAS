In a standard installation of gsoap this directory contains copies of
a number of XSD and WSDL files published by standardization
organizations like W3C and OASIS.

While the licenses of these files allow free redistribution,
modification of the files are not allowed. Any files that are
redistributed by Debian must have a license that allows modification.
These files have therefore been removed from Debian's redistribution
of gsoap.
