# Because gzip is an essential package, any new dependencies would be a
# huge big deal (must also be essential, require Pre-Depends handling,
# etc).  I therefore carefully manage the control file contents, stick to
# an older debhelper compat level to aid porting and back porting, and am
# careful to only use specific debhelper tools I understand the effects of.
