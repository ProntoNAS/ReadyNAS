Description: Linux Standard Base 4.1 core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of the core of version 4.1 of
 the Linux Standard Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64
 (Itanium), IBM S390, and PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux
 kernel. Future revisions of the specification and this package may
 support the LSB on additional architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its
 presence does not imply that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.

Description: Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a desktop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.
