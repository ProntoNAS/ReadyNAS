"This package contains the administrative tools necessary to run on the "
"Kerberos master server.  However, installing this package does not "
"automatically set up a Kerberos realm.  Doing so requires entering passwords "
"and as such is not well-suited for package installation.  To create the "
"realm, run the krb5_newrealm command. You may also wish to read /usr/share/"
"doc/krb5-kdc/README.KDC and the administration guide found in the krb5-doc "
"package."

"By default, Kerberos4 requests are allowed from principals that do not "
"require preauthentication.  This allows Kerberos4 services to exist while "
"requiring most users to use Kerberos5 clients to get their initial tickets.  "
"These tickets can then be converted to Kerberos4 tickets.  Alternatively, "
"the mode can be set to full, allowing Kerberos4 to get initial tickets even "
"when preauthentication would normally be required, or to disable, which will "
"disable all Kerberos4 support."
