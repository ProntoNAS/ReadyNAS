Description: MIT Kerberos administration runtime libraries
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos5.
 .
 This package contains the administration runtime libraries, used by the
 kadmin protocol and the KDC.
