</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>telnet</B> command is used to communicate with another  host
     using the TELNET protocol.  If <B>telnet</B> is invoked without the
     <I>host</I> argument, it enters  command  mode,  indicated  by  its
     prompt  (  <B>telnet&gt;</B>).   In this mode, it accepts and executes
     the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with arguments,
     it performs an <B>open</B> command with those arguments.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -<B>8</B>   Specify an 8-bit data path.  This causes an attempt  to
          negotiate  the  TELNET  BINARY option on both input and
          output.

     -<B>E</B>   Stop any character from being recognized as  an  escape
          character.

     <B>-F</B>   forward a <I>forwardable</I> copy of the local credentials  to
          the remote system.

     <B>-K</B>   Specify no automatic login to the remote system.

     -<B>L</B>   Specify an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes  the
          BINARY option to be negotiated on output.

     <B>-S</B> <I>tos</I>
          Set the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the  telnet
          connection to the value <I>tos</I>, which can be a numeric TOS
          value (in decimal, or a hex value preceded by 0x, or an
          octal  value  preceded  by  a leading 0) or, on systems
          that support it, a  symbolic  TOS  name  found  in  the
          /etc/iptos file.

     <B>-X</B> <I>atype</I>
          Disable the <I>atype</I> type of authentication.

     <B>-a</B>   Attempt automatic login.  This sends the user name  via
          the  USER  variable of the ENVIRON option, if supported
          by the remote system.  The name used  is  that  of  the
          current  user  as  returned by <B>getlogin(2)</B> if it agrees
          with the current user ID;  otherwise  it  is  the  name
          associated with the user ID.

     -<B>c</B>   Disable the reading of the user's <B>.telnetrc</B> file.  (See
          the <B>toggle</B> <B>skiprc</B> command on this man page.)

     -<B>d</B>   Set the initial value of the <B>debug</B> flag to TRUE

     <B>-e</B> <I>escape</I> <I>char</I>
          Set the initial <B>telnet</B> escape character to <I>escape</I> <I>char</I>.
          If <I>escape</I> <I>char</I> is omitted, then there will be no escape
          character.

     <B>-f</B>   forward a copy of the local credentials to  the  remote
          system.

     <B>-k</B> <I>realm</I>
          If Kerberos authentication is being used, request  that
          telnet  obtain  tickets  for  the  remote host in realm
          <I>realm</I> instead of the remote host's realm, as determined
          by <B>krb_realmofhost(3)</B>.

     <B>-l</B> <I>user</I>
          If the remote system understands  the  ENVIRON  option,
          then  <I>user</I>  will  be  sent  to the remote system as the
          value for the variable USER. This option implies the -<B>a</B>
          option.   This  option  may  also be used with the <B>open</B>
          command.

     <B>-n</B> <I>tracefile</I>
          Open <I>tracefile</I> for recording  trace  information.   See
          the <B>set</B> <B>tracefile</B> command below.

     -<B>r</B>   Specify a user interface similar to <B>rlogin(1)</B>.  In this
          mode,  the  escape  character  is  set to the tilde (~)
          character, unless modified by the -<B>e</B> option.

     <B>-x</B>   Turn on encryption  of  the  data  stream.   When  this
          option  is turned on, <B>telnet</B> will exit with an error if
          authentication cannot be negotiated  or  if  encryption
          cannot be turned on.

     <I>host</I> Indicates the name, alias, or Internet address  of  the
          remote host.

     <I>port</I> Indicates a port number (address  of  an  application).
          If  the  port is not specified, the default <B>telnet</B> port
          (23) is used.

     When in rlogin mode, ~ is the  telnet  escape  character;  a
     line of the form ~. disconnects from the remote host.  Simi-
     larly, the line ~^Z suspends the telnet session.   The  line
     ~^] escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt.

     Once a connection has been opened, <B>telnet</B>  will  attempt  to
     enable the TELNET LINEMODE option.  If this fails, then <B>tel-</B>
     <B>net</B> will revert to one of two input modes: either  ``charac-
     ter  at  a time'' or ``old line by line,'' depending on what
     the remote system supports.

     When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing  is  done  on
     the  local  system,  under the control of the remote system.
     When input editing or character echoing is to  be  disabled,
     the  remote  system will relay that information.  The remote
     system will also relay changes  to  any  special  characters
     that  happen  on  the  remote  system, so that they can take
     effect on the local system.

     In ``character at a time'' mode, most text typed is  immedi-
     ately sent to the remote host for processing.

     In ``old line by line'' mode, all text  is  echoed  locally,
     and  (normally)  only completed lines are sent to the remote
     host.  The ``local echo character'' (initially  ``^E'')  may
     be  used  to  turn  off  and on the local echo.  (This would
     mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being
     echoed).

     If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the <B>localchars</B> flag
     is  TRUE  (the default for ``old line by line''; see below),
     the user's <B>quit</B>, <B>intr</B>,  and  <B>flush</B>  characters  are  trapped
     locally, and sent as TELNET protocol sequences to the remote
     side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled,  then  the  user's
     <B>susp</B> and <B>eof</B> are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and
     <B>quit</B> is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK.  There  are
     options  (see  <B>toggle</B>  <B>autoflush</B> and <B>toggle</B> <B>autosynch</B> below)
     which cause this action to flush subsequent  output  to  the
     terminal  (until  the  remote  host  acknowledges the TELNET
     sequence) and flush previous terminal input (in the case  of
     <B>quit</B> and <B>intr</B>).

     While connected to a remote host, <B>telnet</B> command mode may be
     entered by typing the <B>telnet</B> ``escape character'' (initially
     ``^]'').  When in command mode, the normal terminal  editing
     conventions are available.

     The following <B>telnet</B> commands are available.  Only enough of
     each  command to uniquely identify it need be typed (this is
     also true for arguments to the  <B>mode</B>,  <B>set</B>,  <B>toggle</B>,  <B>unset</B>,
     <B>slc</B>, <B>environ</B>, and <B>display</B> commands).

     <B>auth</B> <I>argument</I> ...
          The  auth  command  manipulates  the  information  sent
          through  the  TELNET  AUTHENTICATE option.  Valid argu-
          ments for the auth command are as follows:

          <B>disable</B> <I>type</I>
               Disables the specified type of authentication.  To
               obtain  a  list  of  available types, use the <B>auth</B>
               <B>disable</B> <B>?</B> command.

          <B>enable</B> <I>type</I>
               Enables the specified type of authentication.   To
               obtain  a  list  of  available types, use the <B>auth</B>
               <B>enable</B> <B>?</B> command.

          <B>status</B>
               Lists the current status of the various  types  of
               authentication.

     <B>close</B>
          Close a TELNET session and return to command mode.

     <B>display</B> <I>argument</I> ...
          Displays some or all of the <B>set</B> and <B>toggle</B> values  (see
          below).

     <B>encrypt</B> <I>argument</I> ...
          The encrypt command manipulates  the  information  sent
          through the TELNET ENCRYPT option.

     Note:  Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option
     is not supported outside of the United States and Canada.

     Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as follows:

          <B>disable</B> <I>type</I> [<B>input</B>|<B>output</B>]
               Disables the specified type of encryption.  If you
               omit  the  input and output, both input and output
               are disabled.   To  obtain  a  list  of  available
               types, use the <B>encrypt</B> <B>disable</B> <B>?</B> command.

          <B>enable</B> <I>type</I>]<I>fP</I> [<B>input</B>|<B>output</B>]
               Enables the specified type of encryption.  If  you
               omit  input  and output, both input and output are
               enabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use
               the <B>encrypt</B> <B>enable</B> <B>?</B> command.

          <B>input</B>
               This is the same as the <B>encrypt</B> <B>start</B>  <B>input</B>  com-
               mand.

          -<B>input</B>
               This is the same as the <B>encrypt</B>  <B>stop</B>  <B>input</B>  com-
               mand.

          <B>output</B>
               This is the same as the <B>encrypt</B> <B>start</B> <B>output</B>  com-
               mand.

          -<B>output</B>
               This is the same as the <B>encrypt</B> <B>stop</B>  <B>output</B>  com-
               mand.

          <B>start</B> [<B>input</B>|<B>output</B>]
               Attempts to start encryption.  If you  omit  <B>input</B>
               and <B>output</B>, both input and output are enabled.  To
               obtain a list of available types, use the  <B>encrypt</B>
               <B>enable</B> <B>?</B> command.

          <B>status</B>
               Lists the current status of encryption.

          <B>stop</B> [<B>input</B>|<B>output</B>]
               Stops encryption.  If you omit input  and  output,
               encryption is on both input and output.

          <B>type</B> <I>type</I>
               Sets the default type of  encryption  to  be  used
               with later <B>encrypt</B> <B>start</B> or <B>encrypt</B> <B>stop</B> commands.

     <B>environ</B> <I>arguments</I> ...
          The <B>environ</B> command is used to manipulate the the vari-
          ables  that  my  be  sent  through  the  TELNET ENVIRON
          option.  The initial set of variables is taken from the
          users  environment,  with  only the DISPLAY and PRINTER
          variables being exported by default.  The USER variable
          is also exported if the -<B>a</B> or -<B>l</B> options are used.

     Valid arguments for the <B>environ</B> command are:

          <B>define</B> <I>variable</I> <I>value</I>
               Define the variable <I>variable</I> to have  a  value  of
               <I>value</I>.   Any variables defined by this command are
               automatically exported.  The <I>value</I> may be enclosed
               in single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces
               may be included.

          <B>undefine</B> <I>variable</I>
               Remove <I>variable</I> from the list of environment vari-
               ables.

          <B>export</B> <I>variable</I>
               Mark the variable <I>variable</I> to be exported  to  the
               remote side.

          <B>unexport</B> <I>variable</I>
               Mark the variable  <I>variable</I>  to  not  be  exported
               unless explicitly asked for by the remote side.

          <B>list</B> List the current  set  of  environment  variables.
               Those  marked with a * will be sent automatically;
               other variables will only be  sent  if  explicitly
               requested.

          <B>?</B>    Prints  out  help  information  for  the   <B>environ</B>
               command.

     <B>logout</B>
          Sends the TELNET LOGOUT  option  to  the  remote  side.
          This command is similar to a <B>close</B> command; however, if
          the remote side does not  support  the  LOGOUT  option,
          nothing  happens.   If,  however,  the remote side does
          support the LOGOUT option, this  command  should  cause
          the remote side to close the TELNET connection.  If the
          remote side also supports the concept of  suspending  a
          user's session for later reattachment, the logout argu-
          ment indicates that you should  terminate  the  session
          immediately.

     <B>mode</B> <I>type</I>
          <I>Type</I> is one of several options, depending on the  state
          of  the  TELNET  session.  The remote host is asked for
          permission to go  into  the  requested  mode.   If  the
          remote  host  is  capable  of  entering  that mode, the
          requested mode will be entered.

          <B>character</B>
               Disable the TELNET LINEMODE  option,  or,  if  the
               remote  side  does  not  understand  the  LINEMODE
               option, then enter ``character at a time'' mode.

          <B>line</B> Enable the TELNET  LINEMODE  option,  or,  if  the
               remote  side  does  not  understand  the  LINEMODE
               option, then attempt to enter ``old-line-by-line''
               mode.

          <B>isig</B> (-<I>isig</I>)
               Attempt to enable (disable) the  TRAPSIG  mode  of
               the  LINEMODE  option.   This  requires  that  the
               LINEMODE option be enabled.

          <B>edit</B> (<B>-edit</B>)
               Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode  of  the
               LINEMODE  option.  This requires that the LINEMODE
               option be enabled.

          <B>softtabs</B> (<B>-softtabs</B>)
               Attempt to enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB  mode  of
               the  LINEMODE  option.   This  requires  that  the
               LINEMODE option be enabled.

          <B>litecho</B> (<B>-litecho</B>)
               Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO  mode  of
               the  LINEMODE  option.   This  requires  that  the
               LINEMODE option be enabled.

          <B>?</B>    Prints out help information for the <B>mode</B> command.

     <B>open</B> <I>host</I> [<B>-a</B>] [[<B>-l</B>] <I>user</I>] [<B>-</B><I>port</I>]
          Open a connection to the named host.  If no port number
          is  specified,  <B>telnet</B> will attempt to contact a TELNET
          server at the default port.  The host specification may
          be  either  a  host  name  (see <B>hosts(5)</B> or an Internet
          address specified in the ``dot notation'' (see <B>inet(3)</B>.
          After  establishing a connection, the file <B>.telnetrc</B> in
          the user's home directory is opened.   Lines  beginning
          with  a  # are comment lines.  Blank lines are ignored.
          Lines that begin without white space are the start of a
          machine entry.  The first thing on the line is the name
          of the machine that is being connected to.  The rest of
          the  line,  and  successive lines that begin with white
          space are assumed to be <B>telnet</B> commands  and  are  pro-
          cessed  as  if  they  had been typed in manually to the
          <B>telnet</B> command prompt.

          -<B>a</B>   Attempt automatic login.  This sends the user name
               via  the  USER  variable of the ENVIRON option, if
               supported by the remote system.  The name used  is
               that  of  the  current  user as returned by <I>getlo-</I>
               <B>gin(2)</B> if it agrees with the current user ID; oth-
               erwise it is the name associated with the user ID.

          [<B>-l</B>] <I>user</I>
               may be used to specify the user name to be  passed
               to the remote system via the ENVIRON option.

          <B>-</B><I>port</I>
               When connecting to  a  non-standard  port,  <B>telnet</B>
               omits  any automatic initiation of TELNET options.
               When the port number is preceded by a minus  sign,
               the initial option negotiation is done.

     <B>quit</B> Close any open TELNET session and exit <B>telnet</B>.  An  end
          of file (in command mode) will also close a session and
          exit.

     <B>send</B> <I>arguments</I>
          Sends one or more special character  sequences  to  the
          remote host.  The following are the arguments which may
          be specified (more than one argument may  be  specified
          at a time):

          <B>abort</B>
               Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

          <B>ao</B>   Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which
               should cause the remote system to flush all output
               <I>from</I> the remote system <I>to</I> the user's terminal.

          <B>ayt</B>  Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence,  to
               which  the  remote system may or may not choose to
               respond.

          <B>brk</B>  Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence,  which  may
               have significance to the remote system.

          <B>ec</B>   Sends the TELNET EC  (Erase  Character)  sequence,
               which  should cause the remote system to erase the
               last character entered.

          <B>el</B>   Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line)  sequence,  which
               should  cause  the remote system to erase the line
               currently being entered.

          <B>eof</B>  Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

          <B>eor</B>  Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

          <B>escape</B>
               Sends  the  current  escape  character  (initially
               ``^''.

          <B>ga</B>   Sends the TELNET GA  (Go  Ahead)  sequence,  which
               likely has no significance to the remote system.

          <B>getstatus</B>
               If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS com-
               mand,  <B>getstatus</B>  will  send the subnegotiation to
               request that the server send  its  current  option
               status.

          <B>ip</B>   Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process)  sequence,
               which  should cause the remote system to abort the
               currently running process.

          <B>nop</B>  Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

          <B>susp</B> Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

          <B>synch</B>
               Sends the TELNET SYNCH  sequence.   This  sequence
               causes the remote system to discard all previously
               typed (but not yet read) input.  This sequence  is
               sent  as  TCP urgent data (and may not work if the
               remote system is a 4.2BSD system -- if it  doesn't
               work, a lower case ``r'' may be echoed on the ter-
               minal).

          <B>do</B> <I>cmd</I>

          <B>dont</B> <I>cmd</I>

          <B>will</B> <I>cmd</I>

          <B>wont</B> <I>cmd</I>
               Sends the TELNET DO  <I>cmd</I>  sequence.   <I>Cmd</I>  can  be
               either  a  decimal  number between 0 and 255, or a
               symbolic name for a specific TELNET command.   <I>Cmd</I>
               can  also  be  either  <B>help</B> or <B>?</B> to print out help
               information, including a list  of  known  symbolic
               names.

          <B>?</B>    Prints out help information for the <B>send</B> command.

     <B>set</B> <I>argument</I> <I>value</I>

     <B>unset</B> <I>argument</I> <I>value</I>
          The <B>set</B> command will set any one of a number of  <B>telnet</B>
          variables  to  a specific value or to TRUE. The special
          value <B>off</B> turns off the function  associated  with  the
          variable;  this  is  equivalent to using the <B>unset</B> com-
          mand.  The <B>unset</B> command will disable or set  to  FALSE
          any  of  the  specified functions.  The values of vari-
          ables may be interrogated  with  the  <B>display</B>  command.
          The  variables  which may be set or unset, but not tog-
          gled, are listed here.  In addition, any of  the  vari-
          ables  for  the <B>toggle</B> command may be explicitly set or
          unset using the <B>set</B> and <B>unset</B> commands.

          <B>ayt</B>  If <B>telnet</B> is in localchars mode,  or  LINEMODE  is
               enabled, and the status character is typed, a TEL-
               NET AYT sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>ayt</B> preceding) is  sent
               to  the  remote  host.   The initial value for the
               "Are You There" character is the terminal's status
               character.

          <B>echo</B> This is the value (initially ``^E'')  which,  when
               in  ``line  by  line'' mode, toggles between doing
               local echoing of entered  characters  (for  normal
               processing),  and  suppressing  echoing of entered
               characters (for entering, say, a password).

          <B>eof</B>  If <B>telnet</B> is operating in LINEMODE or  ``old  line
               by  line''  mode,  entering  this character as the
               first character on a line will cause this  charac-
               ter  to be sent to the remote system.  The initial
               value of the eof character  is  taken  to  be  the
               terminal's <B>eof</B> character.

          <B>erase</B>
               If  <B>telnet</B>  is  in  mode  (see  <B>toggle</B>  <B>localchars</B>
               below),  <I>and</I> if <B>telnet</B> is operating in ``character
               at a time'' mode,  then  when  this  character  is
               typed, a TELNET EC sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>ec</B> above) is
               sent to the remote system.  The initial value  for
               the  erase character is taken to be the terminal's
               <B>erase</B> character.

          <B>escape</B>
               This is the  <B>telnet</B>  escape  character  (initially
               ``^['')  which  causes  entry  into <B>telnet</B> command
               mode (when connected to a remote system).

          <B>flushoutput</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is in <B>localchars</B> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <B>local-</B>
               <B>chars</B>  below)  and  the  <B>flushoutput</B>  character is
               typed, a TELNET AO sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>ao</B> above) is
               sent  to  the  remote host.  The initial value for
               the flush character is taken to be the  terminal's
               <B>flush</B> character.

          <B>forw1</B>

          <B>forw2</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is operating in LINEMODE, these are  the
               characters  that,  when typed, cause partial lines
               to be forwarded to the remote system.  The initial
               value for the forwarding characters are taken from
               the terminal's eol and eol2 characters.

          <B>interrupt</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is in <B>localchars</B> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <B>local-</B>
               <B>chars</B> below) and the <B>interrupt</B> character is typed,
               a TELNET IP sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>ip</B> above)  is  sent
               to  the  remote  host.   The initial value for the
               interrupt character is taken to be the  terminal's
               <B>intr</B> character.

          <B>kill</B> If <B>telnet</B> is in <B>localchars</B> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <B>local-</B>
               <B>chars</B>  below),  <I>and</I>  if  <B>telnet</B>  is  operating  in
               ``character at a time'' mode, then when this char-
               acter  is typed, a TELNET EL sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>el</B>
               above) is sent to the remote system.  The  initial
               value  for  the  kill character is taken to be the
               terminal's <B>kill</B> character.

          <B>lnext</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is operating in LINEMODE or  ``old  line
               by line'' mode, then this character is taken to be
               the terminal's <B>lnext</B> character.  The initial value
               for  the  lnext  character  is  taken  to  be  the
               terminal's <B>lnext</B> character.

          <B>quit</B> If <B>telnet</B> is in <B>localchars</B> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <B>local-</B>
               <B>chars</B>  below)  and  the <B>quit</B> character is typed, a
               TELNET BRK sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>brk</B> above)  is  sent
               to  the  remote  host.   The initial value for the
               quit character is taken to be the terminal's  <B>quit</B>
               character.

          <B>reprint</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is operating in LINEMODE or  ``old  line
               by line'' mode, then this character is taken to be
               the terminal's  <B>reprint</B>  character.   The  initial
               value for the reprint character is taken to be the
               terminal's <B>reprint</B> character.

          <B>rlogin</B>
               This is the rlogin escape character.  If set,  the
               normal  <B>TELNET</B>  escape character is ignored unless
               it is preceded by this character at the  beginning
               of  a line.  This character, at the beginning of a
               line followed by a  "."   closes  the  connection;
               when  followed by a ^Z it suspends the telnet com-
               mand.  The initial state is to disable the  rlogin
               escape character.

          <B>start</B>
               If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has  been
               enabled,  then  this  character is taken to be the
               terminal's <B>start</B> character.  The initial value for
               the  kill  character is taken to be the terminal's
               <B>start</B> character.

          <B>stop</B> If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has  been
               enabled,  then  this  character is taken to be the
               terminal's <B>stop</B> character.  The initial value  for
               the  kill  character is taken to be the terminal's
               <B>stop</B> character.

          <B>susp</B> If <B>telnet</B> is in <B>localchars</B> mode,  or  LINEMODE  is
               enabled,  and  the  <B>suspend</B>  character is typed, a
               TELNET SUSP sequence (see <B>send</B> <B>susp</B> above) is sent
               to  the  remote  host.   The initial value for the
               suspend character is taken to  be  the  terminal's
               <B>suspend</B> character.

          <B>tracefile</B>
               This is the file to which the  output,  caused  by
               <B>netdata</B>  or  <B>option</B>  tracing  being  TRUE, will be
               written.  If it is  set  to  ``<B>-</B>'',  then  tracing
               information  will  be  written  to standard output
               (the default).

          <B>worderase</B>
               If <B>telnet</B> is operating in LINEMODE or  ``old  line
               by line'' mode, then this character is taken to be
               the terminal's <B>worderase</B> character.   The  initial
               value  for  the worderase character is taken to be
               the terminal's <B>worderase</B> character.

          <B>?</B>    Displays the legal <B>set</B> (<B>unset</B>) commands.

     <B>slc</B> <I>state</I>
          The <B>slc</B> command (Set Local Characters) is used  to  set
          or  change the state of the the special characters when
          the TELNET LINEMODE option has been  enabled.   Special
          characters  are  characters  that  get mapped to <B>telnet</B>
          commands sequences (like <B>ip</B> or <B>quit</B> <B>)</B> or  line  editing
          characters  (like  <B>erase</B>  and  <B>kill</B>).   By default, the
          local special characters are exported.

          <B>check</B>
               Verify the current settings for the  current  spe-
               cial  characters.  The remote side is requested to
               send all the current special  character  settings,
               and  if there are any discrepancies with the local
               side, the local side will  switch  to  the  remote
               value.

          <B>export</B>
               Switch to the local defaults for the special char-
               acters.  The local default characters are those of
               the local terminal at the  time  when  <B>telnet</B>  was
               started.

          <B>import</B>
               Switch to the  remote  defaults  for  the  special
               characters.   The  remote  default  characters are
               those of the remote system at the  time  when  the
               TELNET connection was established.

          <B>?</B>    Prints out help information for the <B>slc</B> command.

     <B>status</B>
          Show the current status of <B>telnet</B>.  This  includes  the
          peer one is connected to, as well as the current mode.

     <B>toggle</B> <I>arguments</I> ...
          Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that con-
          trol how <B>telnet</B> responds to events.  These flags may be
          set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the <B>set</B> and <B>unset</B>
          commands  listed  above.  More than one argument may be
          specified.  The state of these flags  may  be  interro-
          gated with the <B>display</B> command.  Valid arguments are:

          <B>authdebug</B>
               Turns on debugging information for the authentica-
               tion code.

          <B>autoflush</B>
               If <B>autoflush</B> and <B>localchars</B> are both TRUE  ,  then
               when  the  <B>ao</B>,  or  <B>quit</B> characters are recognized
               (and transformed into TELNET  sequences;  see  <B>set</B>
               above  for details), <B>telnet</B> refuses to display any
               data on the user's terminal until the remote  sys-
               tem acknowledges (via a TELNET TIMING MARK option)
               that it has processed those TELNET sequences.  The
               initial  value for this toggle is TRUE if the ter-
               minal user had not done an "stty  noflsh",  other-
               wise FALSE (see <B>stty(1)</B>.

          <B>autodecrypt</B>
               When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is  negotiated,  by
               default  the actual encryption (decryption) of the
               data stream does  not  start  automatically.   The
               autoencrypt   (autodecrypt)  command  states  that
               encryption of the output (input) stream should  be
               enabled as soon as possible.

          Note:  Because of export controls, the  TELNET  ENCRYPT
          option  is  not supported outside the United States and
          Canada.

          <B>autologin</B>
               If the remote side supports the TELNET AUTHENTICA-
               TION  option  <B>telnet</B> attempts to use it to perform
               automatic authentication.  If  the  AUTHENTICATION
               option is not supported, the user's login name are
               propagated  through  the  TELNET  ENVIRON  option.
               This  command  is  the  same  as specifying the -<B>a</B>
               option on the <B>open</B> command.

          <B>autosynch</B>
               If <B>autosynch</B> and <B>localchars</B> are  both  TRUE,  then
               when  either  the <B>intr</B> or <B>quit</B> characters is typed
               (see <B>set</B> above for descriptions of  the  <B>intr</B>  and
               <B>quit</B>  characters),  the  resulting TELNET sequence
               sent is followed by  the  TELNET  SYNCH  sequence.
               This  procedure  <I>should</I> cause the remote system to
               begin throwing away  all  previously  typed  input
               until  both of the TELNET sequences have been read
               and acted upon.  The initial value of this  toggle
               is FALSE.

          <B>binary</B>
               Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on both
               input and output.

          <B>inbinary</B>
               Enable or disable  the  TELNET  BINARY  option  on
               input.

          <B>outbinary</B>
               Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on out-
               put.

          <B>crlf</B> If this is TRUE, then  carriage  returns  will  be
               sent as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  If this is FALSE, then carriage
               returns will be send as  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;.   The  initial
               value for this toggle is FALSE.

          <B>crmod</B>
               Toggle carriage return mode.  When  this  mode  is
               enabled,  most carriage return characters received
               from the remote host will be mapped  into  a  car-
               riage  return  followed by a line feed.  This mode
               does not affect  those  characters  typed  by  the
               user,  only  those  received from the remote host.
               This mode is not very  useful  unless  the  remote
               host  only  sends  carriage return, but never line
               feed.  The initial value for this toggle is  FALSE
               .

          <B>debug</B>
               Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
               <B>super</B> <B>user</B>).  The initial value for this toggle is
               FALSE .

          <B>encdebug</B>
               Turns on debugging information for the  encryption
               code.

          <B>localchars</B>
               If this is TRUE , then the <B>flush</B>, <B>interrupt</B>, <B>quit</B>,
               <B>erase</B>,  and  <B>kill</B>  characters  (see <B>set</B> above) are
               recognized locally, and  transformed  into  (hope-
               fully)   appropriate   TELNET   control  sequences
               (respectively <B>ao</B>, <B>ip</B>, <B>brk</B>, <B>ec</B>, and  <B>el</B>;  see  <B>send</B>
               above).  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE
               in ``old line by line'' mode, and FALSE in ``char-
               acter  at a time'' mode.  When the LINEMODE option
               is enabled, the value of  <B>localchars</B>  is  ignored,
               and  assumed  to  always  be TRUE. If LINEMODE has
               ever been enabled, then <B>quit</B> is sent as <B>abort</B>, and
               <B>eof</B> and <B>suspend</B> are sent as <B>eof</B> and <B>susp</B>, see <B>send</B>
               above).

          <B>netdata</B>
               Toggles the display of all network data (in  hexa-
               decimal  format).  The initial value for this tog-
               gle is FALSE.

          <B>options</B>
               Toggles  the  display  of  some  internal   <B>telnet</B>
               protocol  processing  (having  to  do  with TELNET
               options).  The initial  value  for  this  flag  is
               FALSE .

          <B>prettydump</B>
               When the <B>netdata</B> flag is enabled, if <B>prettydump</B> is
               enabled  the  output from the <B>netdata</B> command will
               be  formatted  in  a  more  user-readable  format.
               Spaces  are put between each character in the out-
               put,  and  the  beginning  of  any  TELNET  escape
               sequence  is  preceded by a '*' to aid in locating
               them.

          <B>skiprc</B>
               When the skiprc flag is  TRUE,  TELNET  skips  the
               reading  of  the .telnetrc file in the user's home
               directory when connections are opened.   The  ini-
               tial value for this flag is FALSE.

          <B>termdata</B>
               Toggles the display of all terminal data (in hexa-
               decimal  format).  The initial value for this flag
               is FALSE.

          <B>verbose_encrypt</B>
               When the  <B>verbose_encrypt</B>  flag  is  TRUE,  TELNET
               prints  out  a  message  each  time  encryption is
               enabled or disabled.  The initial value  for  this
               toggle  is  FALSE.  Note:   Because of export con-
               trols, data encryption is not supported outside of
               the United States and Canada.

          <B>?</B>    Displays the legal <B>toggle</B> commands.

     <B>z</B>    Suspend <B>telnet</B>.   This  command  only  works  when  the
          user's shell is <B>csh(1)</B>.

     <B>!</B> [<I>command</I>]
          Execute a single command in a  subshell  on  the  local
          system.   If  <B>command</B>  is  omitted, then an interactive
          subshell is invoked.

     <B>?</B> <I>command</I>
          Get help.  With no arguments, prints  a  help  summary.
          If a command is specified, will print the help informa-
          tion for just that command.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <B>Telnet</B> uses at least the  HOME,  SHELL,  DISPLAY,  and  TERM
     environment  variables.   Other environment variables may be
     propagated to the other side via the TELNET ENVIRON option.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     The <B>Telnet</B> command appeared in 4.2BSD.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
     On some remote systems, echo has to be turned  off  manually
     when in ``old line by line'' mode.

     In ``old line by line'' mode or LINEMODE the terminal's  <B>eof</B>
     character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
     when it is the first character on a line.
