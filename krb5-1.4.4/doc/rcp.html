<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Rcp</B> copies files between machines.  Each <I>file</I>  or  <I>directory</I>
     argument   is   either  a  remote  file  name  of  the  form
     ``rhost:path'', or a local  file  name  (containing  no  `:'
     characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     By default, the mode and owner of <I>file2</I> are preserved if  it
     already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file modi-
     fied by the <B>umask(2)</B> on the destination host is used.

     If <I>path</I> is not a full path name, it is interpreted  relative
     to  your  login directory on <I>rhost</I>.  A <I>path</I> on a remote host
     may be quoted (using \, ", or ') so that the  metacharacters
     are interpreted remotely.

     <B>Rcp</B> does not prompt for passwords; it uses Kerberos  authen-
     tication  when  connecting  to  <I>rhost</I>.  Each user may have a
     private authorization list in a file .k5login in  his  login
     directory.  Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
     principal name of  the  form  <I>principal</I>/<I>instance</I>@<I>realm</I>.   If
     there  is  a  ~/.k5login file, then access is granted to the
     account if and only if the originater user is  authenticated
     to one of the principals named in the ~/.k5login file.  Oth-
     erwise, the originating user will be granted access  to  the
     account  if  and only if the authenticated principal name of
     the user can be mapped to the local account name  using  the
     aname  -&gt;  lname  mapping  rules (see <B>krb5_anadd(8)</B> for more
     details).


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -<B>p</B>   attempt to preserve (duplicate) the modification  times
          and  modes  of the source files in the copies, ignoring
          the <I>umask</I>.

     <B>-x</B>   encrypt all information transferring between hosts.

     <B>-k</B> <I>realm</I>
          obtain tickets for the remote host in <I>realm</I> instead  of
          the    remote    host's    realm   as   determined   by
          <B>krb_realmofhost(3)</B>.

     <B>-c</B> <I>ccachefile</I>
          change the default credentials cache file to <I>ccachefile</I>

     <B>-C</B> <I>configfile</I>
          change the default configuation file to <I>configfile</I>

     -<B>r</B>   if any of the source files are directories,  copy  each
          subtree  rooted at that name; in this case the destina-
          tion must be a directory.

     <B>-PN</B>

     <B>-PO</B>  Explicitly request new or old version of  the  Kerberos
          ``rcmd''  protocol.  The new protocol avoids many secu-
          rity problems found in the old one, but is not interop-
          erable  with  older  servers.  (An "input/output error"
          and a closed connection is the most  likely  result  of
          attempting  this  combination.)   If  neither option is
          specified, some simple heuristics  are  used  to  guess
          which to try.

     <B>-D</B> <I>port</I>
          connect to port <I>port</I> on the remote machine.

     -<B>N</B>   use a network connection, even when  copying  files  on
          the local machine (used for testing purposes).

     -<B>f</B> -<B>t</B>
          These options are for internal use only.  They tell the
          remotely-running  rcp process (started via the Kerberos
          remote shell daemon) which direction  files  are  being
          sent.   These  options  should not be used by the user.
          In particular, <B>-f</B> does <B>not</B> mean that  the  user's  Ker-
          beros ticket should be forwarded!

     <B>Rcp</B> handles third party copies,  where  neither  source  nor
     target files are on the current machine.  Hostnames may also
     take the form ``rname@rhost'' to use <I>rname</I> rather  than  the
     current user name on the remote host.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     ~/.k5login  (on remote  host)  -  file  containing  Kerberos
                 principals that are allowed access.

</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     <B>Rcp</B> doesn't detect all cases where  the  target  of  a  copy
     might  be  a  file in cases where only a directory should be
     legal.
     <B>Rcp</B> is confused by any output generated  by  commands  in  a
     .login, .profile, or .cshrc file on the remote host.

     Kerberos is only used for the first connection of  a  third-
     party copy; the second connection uses the standard Berkeley
     rcp protocol.
