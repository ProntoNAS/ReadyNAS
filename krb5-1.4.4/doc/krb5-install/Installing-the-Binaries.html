<h3 class="section">Installing the Binaries</h3>

<p>Once you have built Kerberos, you should install the binaries.  You
can do this by running:

<pre class="example">     % make install
     </pre>

<p>If you want to install the binaries into a destination directory that
is not their final destination, which may be convenient if you want to
build a binary distribution to be deployed on multiple hosts, you may
use:

<pre class="example">     % make install DESTDIR=/path/to/destdir
     </pre>

<p>This will install the binaries under <code>DESTDIR/PREFIX</code>, e.g., the
user programs will install into <code>DESTDIR/PREFIX/bin</code>, the
libraries into <code>DESTDIR/PREFIX/lib</code>, etc.

<p>Note that if you want to test the build (see <a href="Testing-the-Build.html#Testing%20the%20Build">Testing the Build</a>),
you usually do not need to do a <code>make install</code> first.

<p>Some implementations of <code>make</code> allow multiple commands to be run in
parallel, for faster builds.  We test our Makefiles in parallel builds with
GNU <code>make</code> only; they may not be compatible with other parallel build
implementations.
