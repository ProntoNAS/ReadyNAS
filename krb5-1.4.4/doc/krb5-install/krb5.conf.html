<h5 class="subsubsection">krb5.conf</h5>

<p>The <code>krb5.conf</code> file contains Kerberos configuration information,
including the locations of KDCs and admin servers for the Kerberos
realms of interest, defaults for the current realm and for Kerberos
applications, and mappings of hostnames onto Kerberos realms.  Normally,
you should install your <code>krb5.conf</code> file in the directory
<code>/etc</code>.  You can override the default location by setting the
environment variable <code>KRB5_CONFIG</code>.

<p>The <code>krb5.conf</code> file is set up in the style of a Windows INI file. 
Sections are headed by the section name, in square brackets.  Each
section may contain zero or more relations, of the form:

<pre class="smallexample">     foo = bar
     </pre>

<p>or

<pre class="smallexample">     fubar = {
             foo = bar
             baz = quux
     }
     </pre>

<p>Placing a `*' at the end of a line indicates that this is the
<dfn>final</dfn> value for the tag.  This means that neither the remainder
of this configuration file nor any other configuration file will be
checked for any other values for this tag.

<p>For example, if you have the following lines:

<pre class="smallexample">     foo = bar*
     foo = baz
     </pre>

<p>then the second value of foo (baz) would never be read.

<p>The <code>krb5.conf</code> file may contain any or all of the following
sections:

     <dl>
<dt><b>libdefaults</b>
     <dd>Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 library.

     <dt><b>login</b>
     <dd>Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 login program.

     <dt><b>appdefaults</b>
     <dd>Contains default values that can be used by Kerberos V5 applications.

     <dt><b>realms</b>
     <dd>Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names.  Each subsection
describes realm-specific information, including where to find the
Kerberos servers for that realm.

     <dt><b>domain_realm</b>
     <dd>Contains relations which map domain names and subdomains onto Kerberos
realm names.  This is used by programs to determine what realm a host
should be in, given its fully qualified domain name.

     <dt><b>logging</b>
     <dd>Contains relations which determine how Kerberos programs are to perform
logging.

     <dt><b>capaths</b>
     <dd>Contains the authentication paths used with direct (nonhierarchical)
cross-realm authentication.  Entries in this section are used by the
client to determine the intermediate realms which may be used in
cross-realm authentication.  It is also used by the end-service when
checking the transited field for trusted intermediate realms.

</dl>

<p>If you are not using DNS TXT records, you must specify the
<code>default_realm</code> in the <code>libdefaults</code> section.  If you are not
using DNS SRV records, you must include the <code>kdc</code> tag for each
realm in the <code>realms</code> section.  To communicate with the kadmin
server in each realm, the <code>admin_server</code> tag must be set in the
<code>realms</code> section.  If your domain name and realm name are not the
same, you must provide a translation in <code>domain_realm</code>.  It is
also higly recommeneded that you create a <code>[logging]</code> stanza if
the computer will be functioning as a KDC so that the KDC and kadmind
will generate logging output.

<p>An example <code>krb5.conf</code> file:

<pre class="smallexample">     [libdefaults]
         default_realm = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     
     [realms]
         ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
         	kdc = kerberos.mit.edu
         	kdc = kerberos-1.mit.edu
         	kdc = kerberos-2.mit.edu
         	admin_server = kerberos.mit.edu
         {
     
     [logging]
         kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
         admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
         default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log
     </pre>
