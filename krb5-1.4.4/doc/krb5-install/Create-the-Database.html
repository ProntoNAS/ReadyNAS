<h5 class="subsubsection">Create the Database</h5>

<p>You will use the <code>kdb5_util</code> command <em>on the Master KDC</em> to
create the Kerberos database and the optional stash file.  The
<dfn>stash file</dfn> is a local copy of the master key that resides in
encrypted form on the KDC's local disk.  The stash file is used to
authenticate the KDC to itself automatically before starting the
<code>kadmind</code> and <code>krb5kdc</code> daemons (<i>e.g.,</i> as part of the
machine's boot sequence).  The stash file, like the keytab file
(see See <a href="The-Keytab-File.html#The%20Keytab%20File">The Keytab File</a>, for more information) is a potential
point-of-entry for a break-in,
and if compromised, would allow unrestricted access to the Kerberos
database.  If you choose to install a stash file, it should be readable
only by root, and should exist only on the KDC's local disk.  The file
should not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to the
backup data is secured as tightly as access to the master password
itself.

<p>Note that <code>kdb5_util</code> will prompt you for the master key for the
Kerberos database.  This key can be any string.  A good key is one you
can remember, but that no one else can guess.  Examples of bad keys are
words that can be found in a dictionary, any common or popular name,
especially a famous person (or cartoon character), your username in any
form (<i>e.g.</i>, forward, backward, repeated twice, <i>etc.</i>), and any of
the sample keys that appear in this manual.  One example of a key which
might be good if it did not appear in this manual is "MITiys4K5!",
which represents the sentence "MIT is your source for Kerberos 5!" 
(It's the first letter of each word, substituting the numeral "4" for
the word "for", and includes the punctuation mark at the end.)

<p>The following is an example of how to create a Kerberos database and
stash file on the master KDC, using the <code>kdb5_util</code> command.  (The
line that begins with =&gt; is a continuation of the previous line.) 
Replace <i>ATHENA.MIT.EDU</i> with the name of your Kerberos realm.

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -r ATHENA.MIT.EDU -s
     <b>Initializing database '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal' for
     =&gt; realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
     master key name 'K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
     You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
     It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.</b>
     <b>Enter KDC database master key:</b>  <i>&lt;= Type the master password.</i>
     <b>Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:</b>  <i>&lt;= Type it again.</i>
     <b>shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>This will create five files in the directory specified in your
<code>kdc.conf</code> file:  two Kerberos database files, <code>principal.db</code>,
and <code>principal.ok</code>; the Kerberos administrative database file,
<code>principal.kadm5</code>; the administrative database lock file,
<code>principal.kadm5.lock</code>; and the stash file, <code>.k5stash</code>.  (The
default directory is <code>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc</code>.)  If you do not
want a stash file, run the above command without the <code>-s</code> option.
