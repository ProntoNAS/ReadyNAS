<p>The <code>gethostbyname()</code> routine is broken; it does not return a fully
qualified domain name, even if you are using the Domain Name Service
routines.  Since Kerberos V5 uses the fully qualified domain name as the
second component of a service principal (i.e,
<code>host/tsx-11.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</code>), this causes problems for servers
who try to figure out their own fully qualified domain name.

<p>Workarounds:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>   Supply your own resolver library. (such as bind-4.9.3pl1 available
from ftp.vix.com)

     <li>   Upgrade to Solaris 2.4

     <li>   Make sure your /etc/nsswitch.conf has `files' before `dns' like:

     <pre class="example">          hosts:      files dns
          </pre>

     <p>and then in /etc/hosts, make sure there is a line with your
workstation's IP address and hostname, with the fully qualified domain
name first.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          18.172.1.4      dcl.mit.edu dcl
          </pre>

     <p>Note that making this change may cause other programs in your
environment to break or behave differently.

     </ol>
