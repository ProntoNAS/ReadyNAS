<h4 class="subsection">Switching Master and Slave KDCs</h4>

<p>You may occasionally want to use one of your slave KDCs as the master. 
This might happen if you are upgrading the master KDC, or if your master
KDC has a disk crash.

<p>Assuming you have configured all of your KDCs to be able to function as
either the master KDC or a slave KDC (as this document recommends), all
you need to do to make the changeover is:

<p>If the master KDC is still running, do the following on the <em>old</em>
master KDC:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Kill the <code>kadmind</code> process.

     <li>Disable the cron job that propagates the database.

     <li>Run your database propagation script manually, to ensure that the slaves
all have the latest copy of the database.  (See <a href="Propagate-the-Database-to-Each-Slave-KDC.html#Propagate%20the%20Database%20to%20Each%20Slave%20KDC">Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC</a>.)  If there is a need to preserve per-principal
policy information from the database, you should do a "kdb5_util dump
-ov" in order to preserve that information and propogate that dump file
securely by some means to the slave so that its database has the correct
state of the per-principal policy information.
     </ol>

<p>On the <em>new</em> master KDC:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Create a database keytab.  (See <a href="Create-a-kadmind-Keytab--optional-.html#Create%20a%20kadmind%20Keytab%20(optional)">Create a kadmind Keytab (optional)</a>.)

     <li>Start the <code>kadmind</code> daemon.  (See <a href="Start-the-Kerberos-Daemons.html#Start%20the%20Kerberos%20Daemons">Start the Kerberos Daemons</a>.)

     <li>Set up the cron job to propagate the database.  (See <a href="Propagate-the-Database-to-Each-Slave-KDC.html#Propagate%20the%20Database%20to%20Each%20Slave%20KDC">Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC</a>.)

     <li>Switch the CNAMEs of the old and new master KDCs.  (If you don't do
this, you'll need to change the <code>krb5.conf</code> file on every client
machine in your Kerberos realm.)

     </ol>
