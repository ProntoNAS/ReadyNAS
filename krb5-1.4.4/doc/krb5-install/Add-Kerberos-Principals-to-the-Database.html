<h4 class="subsection">Add Kerberos Principals to the Database</h4>

<p>Once your KDCs are set up and running, you are ready to use
<code>kadmin</code> to load principals for your users, hosts, and other
services into the Kerberos database.  This procedure is described fully in the
"Adding or Modifying Principals" section of the Kerberos V5 System
Administrator's Guide.  (See <a href="Create-Host-Keys-for-the-Slave-KDCs.html#Create%20Host%20Keys%20for%20the%20Slave%20KDCs">Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs</a>, for a
brief description.)  The keytab is generated by running <code>kadmin</code>
and issuing the <code>ktadd</code> command.
