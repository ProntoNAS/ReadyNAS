<h4 class="subsection">Solaris 9</h4>

<p>Solaris 9 has a kernel race condition which causes the final output
written to the slave side of a pty to be lost upon the final close()
of the slave device.  This causes the dejagnu-based tests to fail
intermittently.  A workaround exists, but requires some help from the
scheduler, and the "make check" must be executed from a shell with
elevated priority limits.

<p>Run something like

<p><code>priocntl -s -c FX -m 30 -p 30 -i pid nnnn</code>

<p>as root, where <code>nnnn</code> is the pid of the shell whose priority
limit you wish to raise.

<p>Sun has released kernel patches for this race condition.  Apply patch
117171-11 for sparc, or patch 117172-11 for x86.  Later revisions of
the patches should also work.  It is not necessary to run "make
check" from a shell with elevated priority limits once the patch has
been applied.
