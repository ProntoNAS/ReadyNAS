<h5 class="subsubsection">Extract Host Keytabs for the KDCs</h5>

<p>Each KDC (including the master) needs a keytab to decrypt tickets. 
Ideally, you should extract each keytab locally on its own KDC.  If this
is not feasible, you should use an encrypted session to send them across
the network.  To extract a keytab on a KDC called
kerberos.mit.edu, you would execute the following
command:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>kadmin:</b> ktadd host/kerberos.mit.edu
     <b>kadmin: Entry for principal host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 1, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin:</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that the principal must exist in the Kerberos database in order to
extract the keytab.
