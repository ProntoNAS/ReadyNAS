<h3 class="section">Database Propagation</h3>

<p>The Kerberos database resides on the master KDC, and must be propagated
regularly (usually by a cron job) to the slave KDCs.  In deciding how
frequently the propagation should happen, you will need to balance the
amount of time the propagation takes against the maximum reasonable
amount of time a user should have to wait for a password change to take
effect.

<p>If the propagation time is longer than this maximum reasonable time
(<i>e.g.,</i> you have a particularly large database, you have a lot of
slaves, or you experience frequent network delays), you may wish to
cut down on your propagation delay by performing the propagation in
parallel.  To do this, have the master KDC propagate the database to one
set of slaves, and then have each of these slaves propagate the database
to additional slaves.
