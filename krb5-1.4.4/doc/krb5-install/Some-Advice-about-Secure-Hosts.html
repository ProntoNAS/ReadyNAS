<h4 class="subsection">Some Advice about Secure Hosts</h4>

Kerberos V5 can protect your host from certain types of break-ins,
but it is possible to install Kerberos V5 and still leave your host
vulnerable to attack.  Obviously an installation guide is not the place
to try to include an exhaustive list of countermeasures for every
possible attack, but it is worth noting some of the larger holes and how
to close them.

<p>As stated earlier in this section, MIT recommends that on a
secure host, you disable the standard <code>ftp</code>, <code>login</code>,
<code>telnet</code>, <code>shell</code>, and <code>exec</code> services in
<code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>.  We also recommend that secure hosts have an empty
<code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code> file and that there not be a <code>.rhosts</code> file
in <code>root</code>'s home directory.  You can grant Kerberos-authenticated
root access to specific Kerberos principals by placing those principals
in the file <code>.k5login</code> in root's home directory.

<p>We recommend that backups of secure machines exclude the keytab file
(<code>/etc/krb5.keytab</code>).  If this is not possible, the backups should
at least be done locally, rather than over a network, and the backup
tapes should be physically secured.

<p>Finally, the keytab file and any programs run by root, including the
Kerberos V5 binaries, should be kept on local disk.  The keytab file
should be readable only by root.
