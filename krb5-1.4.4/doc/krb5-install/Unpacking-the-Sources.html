<h3 class="section">Unpacking the Sources</h3>

<p>The first step in each of these build procedures is to unpack the
source distribution.  The Kerberos V5 distribution comes in a tar file,
generally named <code>krb5-1.3.tar</code>, which contains a
compressed tar file consisting of the sources for all of Kerberos
(generally <code>krb5-1.3.tar.gz</code>) and a PGP signature for
this source tree (generally <code>krb5-1.3.tar.gz.asc</code>). 
MIT highly recommends that you verify the integrity of the
source code using this signature.

<p>Unpack the compressed tar file in some directory, such as
<code>/u1/krb5-1.3</code>.  (In the rest of this document, we
will assume that you have chosen to unpack the Kerberos V5 source
distribution in this directory.  Note that the tarfiles will by default
all unpack into the <code>./krb5-1.3</code> directory, so that if
your current directory is <code>/u1</code> when you unpack the tarfiles, you
will get <code>/u1/krb5-1.3/src</code>, etc.)
