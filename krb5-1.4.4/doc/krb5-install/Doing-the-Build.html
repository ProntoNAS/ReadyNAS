<h3 class="section">Doing the Build</h3>

<p>You have a number of different options in how to build Kerberos.  If you
only need to build Kerberos for one platform, using a single directory
tree which contains both the source files and the object files is the
simplest.  However, if you need to maintain Kerberos for a large number
of platforms, you will probably want to use separate build trees for
each platform. We recommend that you look at <a href="OS-Incompatibilities.html#OS%20Incompatibilities">OS Incompatibilities</a>, for notes that we have on particular operating
systems.
