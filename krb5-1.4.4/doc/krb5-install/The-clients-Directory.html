<h4 class="subsection">The clients Directory</h4>

<p>This directory contains the code for several user-oriented programs.

     <dl>
<dt><b>kdestroy</b>
     <dd>This program destroys the user's active Kerberos authorization tickets. 
MIT recommends that users <code>kdestroy</code> before logging out.

     <dt><b>kinit</b>
     <dd>This program prompts users for their Kerberos principal name and password,
and attempts to get an initial ticket-granting-ticket for that principal.

     <dt><b>klist</b>
     <dd>This program lists the Kerberos principal and Kerberos tickets held in
a credentials cache, or the keys held in a keytab file.

     <dt><b>kpasswd</b>
     <dd>This program changes a user's Kerberos password.

     <dt><b>ksu</b>
     <dd>This program is a Kerberized version of the <code>su</code> program that is
meant to securely change the real and effective user ID to that of the
target user and to create a new security context.

     <dt><b>kvno</b>
     <dd>This program acquires a service ticket for the specified Kerberos
principals and prints out the key version numbers of each.
