<h4 class="subsection">The DejaGnu Tests</h4>

<p>Some of the built-in regression tests are setup to use the DejaGnu
framework for running tests. These tests tend to be more comprehensive
than the normal built-in tests as they setup test servers and test
client/server activities.

<p>DejaGnu may be found wherever GNU software is archived.

<p>Most of the tests are setup to run as a non-privileged user.  For some
of the krb-root tests to work properly, either (a) the user running the
tests must not have a .k5login file in the home directory or (b) the
.k5login file must contain an entry for <code>&lt;username&gt;@KRBTEST.COM</code>. 
There are two series of tests (<code>rlogind</code> and <code>telnetd</code>) which
require the ability to <code>rlogin</code> as root to the local
machine. Admittedly, this does require the use of a <code>.rhosts</code> file
or some authenticated means. <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>If you cannot obtain root access to your machine, all the other tests
will still run. Note however, with DejaGnu 1.2, the "untested testcases"
will cause the testsuite to exit with a non-zero exit status which
<code>make</code> will consider a failure of the testing process. Do not worry
about this, as these tests are the last run when <code>make check</code> is
executed from the top level of the build tree.  This problem does not
exist with DejaGnu 1.3.

<p>If you are fortunate enough to
have a previous version of Kerberos V5 or V4 installed, and the Kerberos
rlogin is first in your path, you can setup <code>.k5login</code> or
<code>.klogin</code> respectively to allow you access.</p>
