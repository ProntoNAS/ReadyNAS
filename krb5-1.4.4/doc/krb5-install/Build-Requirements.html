<h3 class="section">Build Requirements</h3>

<p>In order to build Kerberos V5, you will need approximately 60-70
megabytes of disk space.  The exact amount will vary depending on the
platform and whether the distribution is compiled with debugging symbol
tables or not.

<p>Your C compiler must conform to ANSI C (ISO/IEC 9899:1990, "c89"). 
Some operating systems do not have an ANSI C compiler, or their
default compiler requires extra command-line options to enable ANSI C
conformance.

<p>If you wish to keep a separate <dfn>build tree</dfn>, which contains the compiled
<code>*.o</code> file and executables, separate from your source tree, you
will need a <code>make</code> program which supports <code>VPATH</code>, or
you will need to use a tool such as <code>lndir</code> to produce a symbolic
link tree for your build tree.
