<h3 class="section">UNIX Application Servers</h3>

<p>An application server is a host that provides one or more services over
the network.  Application servers can be "secure" or "insecure."  A
"secure" host is set up to require authentication from every client
connecting to it.  An "insecure" host will still provide Kerberos
authentication, but will also allow unauthenticated clients to connect.

<p>If you have Kerberos V5 installed on all of your client machines,
MIT recommends that you make your hosts secure, to take
advantage of the security that Kerberos authentication affords. 
However, if you have some clients that do not have Kerberos V5
installed, you can run an insecure server, and still take advantage of
Kerberos V5's single sign-on capability.
