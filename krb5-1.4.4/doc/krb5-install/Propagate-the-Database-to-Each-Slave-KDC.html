<h5 class="subsubsection">Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC</h5>

<p>First, create a dump of the database on the master KDC, as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util dump /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     <b>shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Next, you need to manually propagate the database to each slave KDC, as
in the following example.  (The lines beginning with =&gt; are
continuations of the previous line.):

<pre class="smallexample">     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     =&gt; kerberos-1.mit.edu
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     =&gt; kerberos-2.mit.edu
     </pre>

<p>You will need a script to dump and propagate the database.  The
following is an example of a bourne shell script that will do this. 
(Note that the line that begins with =&gt; is a continuation of the
previous line.  Remember that you need to replace /usr/local with
the name of the directory in which you installed Kerberos V5.)

<pre class="smallexample">     #!/bin/sh
     
     kdclist = "kerberos-1.mit.edu kerberos-2.mit.edu"
     
     /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util "dump
     =&gt; /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans"
     
     for kdc in $kdclist
     do
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans $kdc
     done
     </pre>

<p>You will need to set up a cron job to run this script at the intervals
you decided on earlier (See <a href="Database-Propagation.html#Database%20Propagation">Database Propagation</a>.)
