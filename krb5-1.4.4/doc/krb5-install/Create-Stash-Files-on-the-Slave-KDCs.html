<h5 class="subsubsection">Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs</h5>

<p>Create stash files, by issuing the following commands on each slave KDC:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> kdb5_util stash
     <b>kdb5_util: Cannot find/read stored master key while reading master key
     kdb5_util: Warning: proceeding without master key</b>
     <b>Enter KDC database master key:</b>  <i>&lt;= Enter the database master key.</i>
     <b>shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>As mentioned above, the stash file is necessary for your KDCs to be able
authenticate to themselves, such as when they reboot.  You could run
your KDCs without stash files, but you would then need to type in the
Kerberos database master key by hand every time you start a KDC daemon.
