<h2 class="chapter">Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations</h2>

<p>If you already have an existing Kerberos database that you created with
a prior release of Kerberos 5, you can upgrade it to work with the
current release with the <code>kdb5_util</code> command.  It is only
necessary to perform this dump/undump procedure if you were running a
krb5-1.0.x KDC and are migrating to a krb5-1.1.x or newer KDC or if you
were running a krb5-1.1.x KDC and are migrating to a krb5-1.2.x or newer
KDC.  The process for upgrading a Master KDC involves the following
steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Stop your current KDC and administration
server processes, if any.

     <li>Dump your existing Kerberos database to an ASCII file with
<code>kdb5_util</code>'s "dump" command:

     <pre class="smallexample">          <b>shell%</b> cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          <b>shell%</b> kdb5_util dump old-kdb-dump
          <b>shell%</b> kdb5_util dump -ov old-kdb-dump.ov
          <b>shell%</b>
          </pre>

     <li>Create a new Master KDC installation (See <a href="Install-the-Master-KDC.html#Install%20the%20Master%20KDC">Install the Master KDC</a>.).  If you have a stash file for your current database, choose any
new master password but then copy your existing stash file to the
location specified by your kdc.conf; if you do not have a stash file for
your current database, you must choose the same master password.

     <li>Load your old Kerberos database into the new system with
<code>kdb5_util</code>'s "load" command:

     <pre class="smallexample">          <b>shell%</b> cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          <b>shell%</b> kdb5_util load old-kdb-dump
          <b>shell%</b> kdb5_util load -update old-kdb-dump.ov
          <b>shell%</b>
          </pre>

     </ol>

<p>The "dump -ov" and "load -update" commands are necessary in order to
preserve per-principal policy information, since the default dump format
filters out that information.  If you omit those steps, the loaded
database database will lose the policy information for each principal
that has a policy.

<p>To update a Slave KDC, you must stop the old server processes on the
Slave KDC, install the new server binaries, reload the most recent slave
dump file, and re-start the server processes.
