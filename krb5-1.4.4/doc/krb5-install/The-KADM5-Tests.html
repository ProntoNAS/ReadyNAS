<h4 class="subsection">The KADM5 Tests</h4>

<p>Regression tests for the KADM5 system, including the GSS-RPC, KADM5
client and server libraries, and kpasswd, are also included in this
release.  Each set of KADM5 tests is contained in a sub-directory called
<code>unit-test</code> directly below the system being tested.  For example,
lib/rpc/unit-test contains the tests for GSS-RPC.  The tests are all
based on DejaGnu (but they are not actually called part of "The DejaGnu
tests," whose naming predates the inclusion of the KADM5 system).  In
addition, they require the Tool Command Language (TCL) header files and
libraries to be available during compilation and some of the tests also
require Perl in order to operate.  If all of these resources are not
available during configuration, the KADM5 tests will not run.  The TCL
installation directory can be specified with the <code>--with-tcl</code>
configure option.  (See See <a href="Options-to-Configure.html#Options%20to%20Configure">Options to Configure</a>.)  The runtest and
perl programs must be in the current execution path.

<p>If you install DejaGnu, TCL, or Perl after configuring and building
Kerberos and then want to run the KADM5 tests, you will need to
re-configure the tree and run <code>make</code> at the top level again to make
sure all the proper programs are built.  To save time, you actually only
need to reconfigure and build in the directories src/kadmin/testing,
src/lib/rpc, src/lib/kadm5.
