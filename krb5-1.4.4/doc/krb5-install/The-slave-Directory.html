<h4 class="subsection">The slave Directory</h4>

<p>This directory contains code which allows for the propagation of the
Kerberos principal database from the master KDC to slave KDCs over an
encrypted, secure channel.  <code>kprop</code> is the program which actually
propagates the database dump file.  <code>kpropd</code> is the Kerberos V5
slave KDC update server which accepts connections from the <code>kprop</code>
program.  <code>kslave_update</code> is a script that takes the name of a
slave server, and propagates the database to that server if the
database has been modified since the last dump or if the database has
been dumped since the last propagation.
