<h4 class="subsection">The gen-manpages Directory</h4>

<p>There are two manual pages in this directory.  One is an introduction
to the Kerberos system.  The other describes the <code>.k5login</code> file
which allows users to give access with their UID to other users
authenticated by the Kerberos system.
