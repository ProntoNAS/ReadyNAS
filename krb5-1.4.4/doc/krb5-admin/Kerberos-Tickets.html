<h3 class="section">Kerberos Tickets</h3>

<p>Under Kerberos, the <code>klogind</code> daemon allows you to login to a
remote machine if you can provide <code>klogind</code> a Kerberos ticket
which proves your identity.  In addition to the ticket, you must also
have possession of the corresponding ticket session key. The
combination of a ticket and the ticket's session key is known as a credential.

<p>Typically, a client program automatically obtains credentials
identifying the person using the client program.  The credentials are
obtained from a Kerberos server that resides somewhere on the network. 
A Kerberos server maintains a database of user, server, and password
information.
