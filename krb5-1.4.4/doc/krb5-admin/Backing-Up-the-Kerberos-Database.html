<h3 class="section">Backing Up the Kerberos Database</h3>

<p>As with any file, it is possible that your Kerberos database could
become corrupted.  If this happens on one of the slave KDCs, you might
never notice, since the next automatic propagation of the database would
install a fresh copy.  However, if it happens to the master KDC, the
corrupted database would be propagated to all of the slaves during the
next propagation.  For this reason, MIT recommends that you
back up your Kerberos database regularly.  Because the master KDC is
continuously dumping the database to a file in order to propagate it to
the slave KDCs, it is a simple matter to have a cron job periodically
copy the dump file to a secure machine elsewhere on your network.  (Of
course, it is important to make the host where these backups are stored
as secure as your KDCs, and to encrypt its transmission across your
network.)  Then if your database becomes corrupted, you can load the
most recent dump onto the master KDC.  (See <a href="Restoring-a-Kerberos-Database-from-a-Dump-File.html#Restoring%20a%20Kerberos%20Database%20from%20a%20Dump%20File">Restoring a Kerberos Database from a Dump File</a>.)
