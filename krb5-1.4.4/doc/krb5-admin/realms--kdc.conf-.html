<h4 class="subsection">[realms]</h4>

<p>Each tag in the [realms] section of the file names a Kerberos realm. 
The value of the tag is a subsection where the relations in that
subsection define KDC parameters for that particular realm.

<p>For each realm, the following tags may be specified in the [realms]
subsection:

     <dl>
<dt><b>acl_file</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Location of the access control list (acl) file that kadmin
uses to determine which principals are allowed which permissions on the
database.  The default is <code>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl</code>.

     <dt><b>admin_keytab</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Location of the keytab file that the legacy administration
daemons <code>kadmind4</code> and <code>v5passwdd</code> use to authenticate to
the database.  The default is <code>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab</code>.

     <dt><b>database_name</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Location of the Kerberos database for this realm.  The
default is <br> <code>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal</code>.

     <dt><b>default_principal_expiration</b>
     <dd>(Absolute time string.)  Specifies the default expiration date of
principals created in this realm.  The default value for this tag is
0.

     <dt><b>default_principal_flags</b>
     <dd>(Flag string.)  Specifies the default attributes of principals created
in this realm.  The format for this string is a comma-separated list of
flags, with '+' before each flag that should be enabled and '-' before
each flag that should be disabled.   The default is
postdateable, forwardable, tgt-based, renewable, proxiable, dup-skey, allow-tickets, and service enabled..

     <p>There are a number of possible flags:

          <dl>
<dt><b>postdateable</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain postdateable tickets.

          <dt><b>forwardable</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain forwardable tickets.

          <dt><b>tgt-based</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows a principal to obtain tickets based on a
ticket-granting-ticket, rather than repeating the authentication
process that was used to obtain the TGT.

          <dt><b>renewable</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain renewable tickets.

          <dt><b>proxiable</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain proxy tickets.

          <dt><b>dup-skey</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain a session key for
another user, permitting user-to-user authentication for this principal.

          <dt><b>allow-tickets</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag means that the KDC will issue tickets for this
principal.  Disabling this flag essentially deactivates the principal
within this realm.

          <dt><b>preauth</b>
          <dd>If this flag is enabled on a client principal, then that principal is
required to preauthenticate to the KDC before receiving any tickets. 
On a service principal, enabling this flag means that service tickets
for this principal will only be issued to clients with a TGT that has
the preauthenticated ticket set.

          <dt><b>hwauth</b>
          <dd>If this flag is enabled, then the principal is required to
preauthenticate using a hardware device before receiving any tickets.

          <dt><b>pwchange</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag forces a password change for this principal.

          <dt><b>service</b>
          <dd>Enabling this flag allows the the KDC to issue service tickets for this
principal.

          <dt><b>pwservice</b>
          <dd>If this flag is enabled, it marks this principal as a password change
service.  This should only be used in special cases, for example, if a
user's password has expired, then the user has to get tickets for that
principal without going through the normal password authentication in
order to be able to change the password.

     </dl>

     <dt><b>dict_file</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Location of the dictionary file containing strings that are
not allowed as passwords.  If none is specified or if there is no
policy assigned to the principal, no dictionary checks of passwords
will be performed.

     <dt><b>kadmind_port</b>
     <dd>(Port number.)  Specifies the port on which the kadmind daemon is to
listen for this realm.  The assigned port for kadmind is
749.

     <dt><b>kpasswd_port</b>
     <dd>(Port number.)  Specifies the port on which the kpasswd daemon is to
listen for this realm.  The default is 464.

     <dt><b>key_stash_file</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Specifies the location where the master key has been stored
(via <code>kdb5_util stash</code>).  The default is
<code>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/.k5.</code><i>REALM</i><code></code>, where <i>REALM</i> is the
Kerberos realm.

     <dt><b>kdc_ports</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Specifies the list of ports that the KDC is to listen to
for UDP requests for this realm.  By default, the value of kdc_ports
as specified in the [kdcdefaults] section is used.

     <dt><b>kdc_tcp_ports</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Specifies the list of ports that the KDC is to listen to
for TCP requests for this realm.  By default, the value of
kdc_tcp_ports as specified in the [kdcdefaults] section is used.

     <dt><b>master_key_name</b>
     <dd>(String.)  Specifies the name of the principal associated with the
master key.  The default is K/M.

     <dt><b>master_key_type</b>
     <dd>(Key type string.)  Specifies the master key's key type.  The default
value for this is des3-cbc-sha1.  For a list of all
possible values, see <a href="Supported-Encryption-Types.html#Supported%20Encryption%20Types">Supported Encryption Types</a>.

     <dt><b>max_life</b>
     <dd>(Delta time string.)  Specifes the maximum time period for which a
ticket may be valid in this realm.  The default value is
10 hours.

     <dt><b>max_renewable_life</b>
     <dd>(Delta time string.)  Specifies the maximum time period during which a
valid ticket may be renewed in this realm.  The default value is
0.

     <dt><b>supported_enctypes</b>
     <dd>List of key:salt strings.  Specifies the default key/salt combinations of
principals for this realm.  Any principals created through <code>kadmin</code>
will have keys of these types.  The default value for this tag is
des3-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-crc:normal. For lists of possible values, see
<a href="Supported-Encryption-Types.html#Supported%20Encryption%20Types">Supported Encryption Types</a> and <a href="Salts.html#Salts">Salts</a>.

     <dt><b>reject_bad_transit</b>
     <dd>A boolean value (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>).  If set to <code>true</code>, the
KDC will check the list of transited realms for cross-realm tickets
against the transit path computed from the realm names and the
<code>capaths</code> section of its <code>krb5.conf</code> file; if the path in the
ticket to be issued contains any realms not in the computed path, the
ticket will not be issued, and an error will be returned to the client
instead.  If this value is set to <code>false</code>, such tickets will be
issued anyways, and it will be left up to the application server to
validate the realm transit path.

     <p>If the <code>disable-transited-check</code> flag is set in the incoming
request, this check is not performed at all.  Having the
<code>reject_bad_transit</code> option will cause such ticket requests to be
rejected always.

     <p>This transit path checking and config file option currently apply only
to TGS requests.

     <p>Earlier versions of the MIT release (before 1.2.3) had bugs in the
application server support such that the server-side checks may not be
performed correctly.  We recommend turning this option on, unless you
know that all application servers in this realm have been updated to
fixed versions of the software, and for whatever reason, you don't want
the KDC to do the validation.

     <p>This is a per-realm option so that multiple-realm KDCs may control it
separately for each realm, in case (for example) one realm has had the
software on its application servers updated but another has not.

     <p>This option defaults to <code>true</code>.
