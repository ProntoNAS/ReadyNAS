<h3 class="section">The Ticket-Granting Ticket</h3>

<p>The <code>kinit</code> command prompts for your password.  If you enter it
successfully, you will obtain a <dfn>ticket-granting ticket</dfn> and a
<dfn>ticket session key</dfn> which gives you the right to use the ticket. 
This combination of the ticket and its associated key is known as your
<dfn>credentials</dfn>.  As illustrated below, client programs use your
ticket-granting ticket credentials in order to obtain client-specific
credentials as needed.

<p>Your credentials are stored in a <dfn>credentials cache</dfn>, which is often
just a file in <code>/tmp</code>.  The credentials cache is also called the
<dfn>ticket file</dfn>, especially in Kerberos V4 documentation.  Note,
however, that a credentials cache does not have to be stored in a file.
