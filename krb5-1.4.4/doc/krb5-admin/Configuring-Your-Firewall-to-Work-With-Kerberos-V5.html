<h3 class="section">Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5</h3>

<p>If you need off-site users to be able to get Kerberos tickets in your
realm, they must be able to get to your KDC.  This requires either that
you have a slave KDC outside your firewall, or you configure your
firewall to allow UDP requests into at least one of your KDCs, on
whichever port the KDC is running.  (The default is port
88; other ports may be specified in the KDC's kdc.conf
file.)  Similarly, if you need off-site users to be able to change
their passwords in your realm, they must be able to get to your
Kerberos admin server.  The default port for the admin server is
749.

<p>If your on-site users inside your firewall will need to get to KDCs in
other realms, you will also need to configure your firewall to allow
outgoing TCP and UDP requests to port 88. 
Additionally, if they will need to get to any Kerberos V4 KDCs, you may
also need to allow TCP and UDP requests to port
750.  If your on-site users inside your firewall
will need to get to Kerberos admin servers in other realms, you will
also need to allow outgoing TCP and UDP requests to port
749.

<p>If any of your KDCs are outside your firewall, you will need to allow
<code>kprop</code> requests to get through to the remote KDC.  <code>Kprop</code>
uses the krb5_prop service on port 754 (tcp).

<p>If you need your off-site users to have access to machines inside your
firewall, you need to allow TCP connections from their off-site hosts on
the appropriate ports for the programs they will be using.  The
following lines from <code>/etc/services</code> show the default port numbers
for the Kerberos V5 programs:

<pre class="smallexample">     ftp           21/tcp           # Kerberos ftp and telnet use the
     telnet        23/tcp           # default ports
     kerberos      88/udp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
     kerberos      88/tcp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
     klogin        543/tcp          # Kerberos authenticated rlogin
     kshell        544/tcp   cmd    # and remote shell
     kerberos-adm  749/tcp          # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw
     kerberos-adm  749/udp          # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw
     krb5_prop     754/tcp          # Kerberos slave propagation
     eklogin       2105/tcp         # Kerberos auth. &amp; encrypted rlogin
     krb524        4444/tcp         # Kerberos 5 to 4 ticket translator
     </pre>

<p>By default, Kerberos V5 <code>telnet</code> and <code>ftp</code> use the same
ports as the standard <code>telnet</code> and <code>ftp</code> programs, so if you
already allow telnet and ftp connections through your firewall, the
Kerberos V5 versions will get through as well.  If you do not
already allow telnet and ftp connections through your firewall, but need
your users to be able to use Kerberos V5 telnet and ftp, you can
either allow ftp and telnet connections on the standard ports, or switch
these programs to non-default port numbers and allow ftp and telnet
connections on those ports to get through.

Kerberos V5 <code>rlogin</code> uses the <code>klogin</code> service, which by
default uses port 543.  Encrypted Kerberos V5
rlogin uses the <code>eklogin</code> service, which by default uses port
2105.

Kerberos V5 <code>rsh</code> uses the <code>kshell</code> service, which by
default uses port 544.  However, the server must
be able to make a TCP connection from the kshell port to an arbitrary
port on the client, so if your users are to be able to use <code>rsh</code>
from outside your firewall, the server they connect to must be able to
send outgoing packets to arbitrary port numbers.  Similarly, if your
users need to run <code>rsh</code> from inside your firewall to hosts outside
your firewall, the outside server needs to be able to connect to an
arbitrary port on the machine inside your firewall.  Because
Kerberos V5 <code>rcp</code> uses <code>rsh</code>, the same issues apply.  If
you need to use <code>rsh</code> (or <code>rcp</code>) through your firewall and
are concerned with the security implications of allowing connections to
arbitrary ports, MIT suggests that you have rules that
specifically name these applications and, if possible, list the allowed
hosts.

<p>The book <cite>UNIX System Security</cite>, by David Curry, is a good
starting point for learning to configure firewalls.
