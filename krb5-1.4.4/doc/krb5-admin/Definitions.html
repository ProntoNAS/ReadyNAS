<h3 class="section">Definitions</h3>

<p>Following are definitions of some of the Kerberos terminology.

     <dl>
<dt><b>client</b>
     <dd>an entity that can obtain a ticket.  This entity is usually either a
user or a host.

     <br><dt><b>host</b>
     <dd>a computer that can be accessed over a network.

     <br><dt><b>Kerberos</b>
     <dd>in Greek mythology, the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the
underworld.  In the computing world, Kerberos is a network security
package that was developed at MIT.

     <br><dt><b>KDC</b>
     <dd>Key Distribution Center.  A machine that issues Kerberos tickets.

     <br><dt><b>keytab</b>
     <dd>a <b>key tab</b>le file containing one or more keys.  A host or service
uses a <dfn>keytab</dfn> file in much the same way as a user uses his/her
password.

     <br><dt><b>principal</b>
     <dd>a string that names a specific entity to which a set of credentials may
be assigned.  It can have an arbitrary number of components, but
generally has three:

          <dl>
<dt><b>primary</b>
          <dd>the first part of a Kerberos <i>principal</i>.  In the case of a user, it
is the username.  In the case of a service, it is the name of the
service.

          <br><dt><b>instance</b>
          <dd>the second part of a Kerberos <i>principal</i>.  It gives information that
qualifies the primary.  The instance may be null.  In the case of a
user, the instance is often used to describe the intended use of the
corresponding credentials.  In the case of a host, the instance is the
fully qualified hostname.

          <br><dt><b>realm</b>
          <dd>the logical network served by a single Kerberos database and a set of
Key Distribution Centers.  By convention, realm names are generally all
uppercase letters, to differentiate the realm from the internet domain. 
</dl>

     <p>The typical format of a typical Kerberos principal is
primary/instance@REALM.

     <br><dt><b>service</b>
     <dd>any program or computer you access over a network.  Examples of services
include "host" (a host, <i>e.g.</i>, when you use <code>telnet</code> and
<code>rsh</code>), "ftp" (FTP), "krbtgt" (authentication;
cf. <i>ticket-granting ticket</i>), and "pop" (email).

     <br><dt><b>ticket</b>
     <dd>a temporary set of electronic credentials that verify the identity of a
client for a particular service.

     <br><dt><b>TGT</b>
     <dd>Ticket-Granting Ticket.  A special Kerberos ticket that permits the
client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets within the same Kerberos
realm.
