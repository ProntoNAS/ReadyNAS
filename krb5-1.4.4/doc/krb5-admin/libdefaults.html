<h4 class="subsection">[libdefaults]</h4>

<p>The <code>libdefaults</code> section may contain any of the following
relations:

     <dl>
<dt><b>default_keytab_name</b>
     <dd>This relation specifies the default keytab name to be used by
application servers such as telnetd and rlogind.  The default is
/etc/krb5.keytab.

     <dt><b>default_realm</b>
     <dd>Identifies the default Kerberos realm for the client.  Set its value to
your Kerberos realm.  If this is not specified and the TXT record
lookup is enabled (see <a href="Using-DNS.html#Using%20DNS">Using DNS</a>), then that information will be
used to determine the default realm.  If this tag is not set in this
configuration file and there is no DNS information found, then an error
will be returned.

     <dt><b>default_tgs_enctypes</b>
     <dd>Identifies the supported list of session key encryption types that
should be returned by the KDC.  The list may be delimited with commas
or whitespace.  Kerberos supports many different encryption types, and
support for more is planned in the future. (see <a href="Supported-Encryption-Types.html#Supported%20Encryption%20Types">Supported Encryption Types</a> for a list of the accepted values for this tag).  The default
value is aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1 arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

     <dt><b>default_tkt_enctypes</b>
     <dd>Identifies the supported list of session key encryption types that
should be requested by the client.  The format is the same as for
<em>default_tgs_enctypes</em>.  The default value for this tag is
aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1 arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

     <dt><b>permitted_enctypes</b>
     <dd>Identifies all encryption types that are permitted for use in session
key encryption.  The default value for this tag is
aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1 arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

     <dt><b>clockskew</b>
     <dd>Sets the maximum allowable amount of clockskew in seconds that the
library  will tolerate before assuming that a Kerberos message is
invalid.  The default value is 300 seconds, or five minutes.

     <dt><b>kdc_timesync</b>
     <dd>If this is set to 1 (for true), then client machines will compute the
difference between their time and the time returned by the KDC in the
timestamps in the tickets and use this value to correct for an
inaccurate system clock.  This corrective factor is only used by the
Kerberos library.  The default is 1.

     <dt><b>kdc_req_checksum_type</b>
     <dd><dt><b>ap_req_checksum_type</b>
     <dd><dt><b>safe_checksum_type</b>
     <dd>An integer which specifies the type of checksum to use.  Used for
compatability with DCE security servers which do not support the
default RSA MD5 used by this version of Kerberos. 
The possible values and their meanings are as follows.

          <dl>
<dt><b>1</b>
          <dd>CRC32
<br><dt><b>2</b>
          <dd>RSA MD4
<br><dt><b>3</b>
          <dd>RSA MD4 DES
<br><dt><b>4</b>
          <dd>DES CBC
<br><dt><b>7</b>
          <dd>RSA MD5
<br><dt><b>8</b>
          <dd>RSA MD5 DES
<br><dt><b>9</b>
          <dd>NIST SHA
<br><dt><b>12</b>
          <dd>HMAC SHA1 DES3
<br><dt><b>-138</b>
          <dd>Microsoft MD5 HMAC checksum type
</dl>

     <dt><b>ccache_type</b>
     <dd>Use this parameter on systems which are DCE clients, to specify the
type of cache to be created by kinit, or when forwarded tickets are
received.  DCE and Kerberos can share the cache, but some versions of
DCE do not support the default cache as created by this version of
Kerberos.  Use a value of 1 on DCE 1.0.3a systems, and a value of 2 on
DCE 1.1 systems.  The default value is 4.

     <dt><b>krb4_srvtab</b>
     <dd>Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 srvtab file.  Default is
/etc/srvtab.

     <dt><b>krb4_config</b>
     <dd>Specifies the location of hte Kerberos V4 configuration file.  Default
is /etc/krb.conf.

     <dt><b>krb4_realms</b>
     <dd>Specifies the location of the Kerberos V4 domain/realm translation
file.  Default is /etc/krb.realms.

     <dt><b>dns_lookup_kdc</b>
     <dd>Indicate whether DNS SRV records should be used to locate the KDCs and
other servers for a realm, if they are not listed in the information for
the realm.  (Note that the <code>admin_server</code> entry must be in the
file, because the DNS implementation for it is incomplete.)

     <p>Enabling this option does open up a type of denial-of-service attack, if
someone spoofs the DNS records and redirects you to another server. 
However, it's no worse than a denial of service, because that fake KDC
will be unable to decode anything you send it (besides the initial
ticket request, which has no encrypted data), and anything the fake KDC
sends will not be trusted without verification using some secret that it
won't know.

     <p>If this option is not specified but <code>dns_fallback</code> is, that value
will be used instead.  If neither option is specified, the behavior
depends on configure-time options; if none were given, the default is to
enable this option.  If the DNS support is not compiled in, this entry
has no effect.

     <dt><b>dns_lookup_realm</b>
     <dd>Indicate whether DNS TXT records should be used to determine the
Kerberos realm of a host.

     <p>Enabling this option may permit a redirection attack, where spoofed DNS
replies persuade a client to authenticate to the wrong realm, when
talking to the wrong host (either by spoofing yet more DNS records or by
intercepting the net traffic).  Depending on how the client software
manages hostnames, however, it could already be vulnerable to such
attacks.  We are looking at possible ways to minimize or eliminate this
exposure.  For now, we encourage more adventurous sites to try using
Secure DNS.

     <p>If this option is not specified but <code>dns_fallback</code> is, that value
will be used instead.  If neither option is specified, the behavior
depends on configure-time options; if none were given, the default is to
disable this option.  If the DNS support is not compiled in, this entry
has no effect.

     <dt><b>dns_fallback</b>
     <dd>General flag controlling the use of DNS for Kerberos information.  If
both of the preceding options are specified, this option has no effect.

     <dt><b>extra_addresses</b>
     <dd>This allows a computer to use multiple local addresses, in order to
allow Kerberos to work in a network that uses NATs.  The addresses
should be in a comma-separated list.

     <dt><b>udp_preference_limit</b>
     <dd>When sending a message to the KDC, the library will try using TCP before
UDP if the size of the message is above <code>udp_preference_list</code>. 
If the message is smaller than <code>udp_preference_list</code>, then UDP
will be tried before TCP.  Regardless of the size, both protocols will
be tried if the first attempt fails.

     <dt><b>verify_ap_req_nofail</b>
     <dd>If this flag is set, then an attempt to get initial credentials will
fail if the client machine does not have a keytab.  The default for the
flag is not set.

     <dt><b>renew_lifetime</b>
     <dd>The value of this tag is the default renewable lifetime for
initial tickets.  The default value for the tag is
0.

     <dt><b>noaddresses</b>
     <dd>Setting this flag causes the initial Kerberos ticket to be addressless. 
The default for the flag is set.

     <dt><b>forwardable</b>
     <dd>If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be forwardable. 
The default value for this flag is not set.

     <dt><b>proxiable</b>
     <dd>If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be proxiable. 
The default value for this flag is not set.
