<h2 class="chapter">Bug Reporting</h2>

<p>In any complex software, there will be bugs.  If you have successfully
built and installed Kerberos V5, please use the <code>krb5-send-pr</code>
program to fill out a Problem Report should you encounter any errors in
our software.

<p>Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
do include fixes, please send them using either context diffs or unified
diffs (using <code>diff -c</code> or <code>diff -u</code>, respectively).  Please be
careful when using "cut and paste" or other such means to copy a patch
into a bug report; depending on the system being used, that can result
in converting TAB characters into spaces, which makes applying the
patches more difficult.

<p>The <code>krb5-send-pr</code> program is installed in the directory
<code>/usr/local/sbin</code>.

<p>The <code>krb5-send-pr</code> program enters the problem report into our
Problem Report Management System (PRMS), which automatically assigns it
to the engineer best able to help you with problems in the assigned
category.

<p>The <code>krb5-send-pr</code> program will try to intelligently fill in as
many fields as it can.  You need to choose the <dfn>category</dfn>,
<dfn>class</dfn>, <dfn>severity</dfn>, and <dfn>priority</dfn> of the problem, as well
as giving us as much information as you can about its exact nature.

<p>The PR <b>category</b> will be one of:

<pre class="smallexample">     krb5-admin   krb5-appl    krb5-build   krb5-clients
     krb5-doc     krb5-kdc     krb5-libs    krb5-misc
     pty          telnet       test
     </pre>

<p>Choose the category that best describes the area under which your
problem falls.

<p>The <b>class</b> can be <dfn>sw-bug</dfn>, <dfn>doc-bug</dfn>, <dfn>change-request</dfn>,
or <dfn>support</dfn>.  The first two are exactly as their names imply.  Use
<i>change-request</i> when the software is behaving according to
specifications, but you want to request changes in some feature or
behavior.  The <i>support</i> class is intended for more general questions
about building or using Kerberos V5.

<p>The <b>severity</b> of the problem indicates the problem's impact on the
usability of Kerberos V5.  If a problem is <dfn>critical</dfn>, that
means the product, component or concept is completely non-operational,
or some essential functionality is missing, and no workaround is known. 
A <dfn>serious</dfn> problem is one in which the product, component or
concept is not working properly or significant functionality is missing. 
Problems that would otherwise be considered <i>critical</i> are rated
<i>serious</i> when a workaround is known.  A <dfn>non-critical</dfn> problem is
one that is indeed a problem, but one that is having a minimal effect on
your ability to use Kerberos V5.  <i>E.g.</i>, The product, component
or concept is working in general, but lacks features, has irritating
behavior, does something wrong, or doesn't match its documentation.  The
default severity is <i>serious</i>.

<p>The <b>priority</b> indicates how urgent this particular problem is in
relation to your work.  Note that low priority does not imply low
importance. 
A priority of <dfn>high</dfn> means a solution is needed as soon as possible. 
A priority of <dfn>medium</dfn> means the problem should be solved no later
than the next release.  A priority of <dfn>low</dfn> means the problem should
be solved in a future release, but it is not important to your work how
soon this happens.  The default priority is <i>medium</i>.

<p>Note that a given severity does not necessarily imply a given priority. 
For example, a non-critical problem might still have a high priority if
you are faced with a hard deadline.  Conversely, a serious problem might
have a low priority if the feature it is disabling is one that you do
not need.

<p>It is important that you fill in the <i>release</i> field and tell us
what changes you have made, if any.

<p>A sample filled-out form from a company named "Toasters, Inc." might
look like this:

<p>If the <code>krb5-send-pr</code> program does not work for you, or if you did
not get far enough in the process to have an installed and working
<code>krb5-send-pr</code>, you can generate your own form, using the above as
an example.
