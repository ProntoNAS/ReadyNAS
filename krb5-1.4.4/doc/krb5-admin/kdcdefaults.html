<h4 class="subsection">[kdcdefaults]</h4>

<p>The following relation is defined in the [kdcdefaults] section:

     <dl>
<dt><b>kdc_ports</b>
     <dd>This relation lists the ports on which the Kerberos server should
listen for UDP requests by default.  This list is a comma separated
list of integers. 
If this relation is not specified, the compiled-in default is
88,750, the first being the assigned Kerberos port
and the second which was used by Kerberos V4.

     <dt><b>kdc_tcp_ports</b>
     <dd>This relation lists the ports on which the Kerberos server should
listen for TCP connections by default.  This list is a comma separated
list of integers. 
If this relation is not specified, the compiled-in default is not to
listen for TCP connections at all.

     <p>If you wish to change this (which we do not recommend, because the
current implementation has little protection against denial-of-service
attacks), the standard port number assigned for Kerberos TCP traffic
is port 88.

     <dt><b>v4_mode</b>
     <dd>This string specifies how the KDC should respond to Kerberos 4
packets.  The possible values are none, disable, full, and nopreauth. 
The default value is none.
