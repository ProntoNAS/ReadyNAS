<h4 class="subsection">[realms]</h4>

<p>Each tag in the [realms] section of the file is the name of a Kerberos
realm.  The value of the tag is a subsection with relations that define
the properties of that particular realm.  For each realm, the following
tags may be specified in the realm's subsection:

     <dl>
<dt><b>kdc</b>
     <dd>The name of a host running a KDC for that realm.  An optional port
number (separated from the hostname by a colon) may be included.  For
your computer to be able to communicate with the KDC for each realm,
this tag must be given a value in each realm subsection in the
configuration file, or there must be DNS SRV records specifying the
KDCs (see <a href="Using-DNS.html#Using%20DNS">Using DNS</a>).

     <dt><b>master_kdc</b>
     <dd>Identifies the master KDC(s).  Currently, this tag is used in only one
case: If an attempt to get credentials fails because of an invalid
password, the client software will attempt to contact the master KDC,
in case the user's password has just been changed, and the updated
database has not been propagated to the slave servers yet.  (We don't
currently check whether the KDC from which the initial response came
is on the master KDC list.  That may be fixed in the future.)

     <dt><b>admin_server</b>
     <dd>Identifies the host where the administration server is running. 
Typically, this is the master Kerberos server.  This tag must be given
a value in order to communicate with the kadmin server for the realm.

     <dt><b>default_domain</b>
     <dd>This tag is used for Kerberos 4 compatibility.  Kerberos 4 does not
require the entire hostname of a server to be in its principal like
Kerberos 5 does.  This tag provides the domain name needed to produce a
full hostname when translating V4 principal names into V5 principal
names.  All servers in this realm are assumed to be in the domain given
as the value of this tag

     <dt><b>v4_instance_convert</b>
     <dd>This subsection allows the administrator to configure exceptions to the
default_domain mapping rule.  It contains V4 instances (the tag name)
which should be translated to some specific hostname (the tag value) as
the second component in a Kerberos V5 principal name.

     <dt><b>v4_realm</b>
     <dd>This relation is used by the krb524 library routines when converting a
V5 principal name to a V4 principal name.  It is used when the V4 realm
name and the V5 realm name are not the same, but still share the same
principal names and passwords.  The tag value is the Kerberos V4 realm
name.

     <dt><b>auth_to_local_names</b>
     <dd>This subsection allows you to set explicit mappings from principal
names to local user names.  The tag is the mapping name, and the value
is the corresponding local user name.

     <dt><b>auth_to_local</b>
     <dd>This tag allows you to set a general rule for mapping principal names
to local user names.  It will be used if there is not an explicit
mapping for the principal name that is being translated.  The possible
values are:

          <dl>

          <br><dt><b>DB:</b><i>filename</i><b></b>
          <dd>The principal will be looked up in the database <i>filename</i>.  Support
for this is not currently compiled in by default.

          <br><dt><b>RULE:</b><i>exp</i><b></b>
          <dd>The local name will be formulated from <i>exp</i>.

          <p>The format for <i>exp</i> is
<code>[</code><i>n</i><code>:$</code><i>d</i><code>..</code><i>string</i><code>](</code><i>regexp</i><code>)s/</code><i>pattern</i><code>/</code><i>replacement</i><code>/g</code>. 
The integer <i>n</i> indicates how many components the target principal
should have.  If this matches, then a string will be formed by putting
together the components of the principal in the order indicated by each
integer <i>d</i>, and the arbitrary string <i>string</i> (i.e. if the
principal was johndoe/admin then [2:$2$1foo] would result in
the string "adminjohndoefoo".  If this string matches
<i>regexp</i>, then the <code>s//[g]</code> substitution command will be run over the
string.  The optional g will cause the substitution to be global over
the string, instead of replacing only the first match in the string.

          <br><dt><b>DEFAULT</b>
          <dd>The principal name will be used as the local user name.  If the
principal has more than one component or is not in the default realm,
this rule is not applicable and the conversion will fail.

     </dl>

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          [realms]
              ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
                  auth_to_local = {
                      RULE:[2:$1](johndoe)s/^.*$/guest/
                      RULE:[2:$1;$2](^.*;admin$)s/;admin$//
                      RULE:[2:$2](^.*;root)s/^.*$/root/
                      DEFAULT
                      }
                  }
          </pre>

     <p>would result in any principal without <code>root</code> or <code>admin</code> as
the second component to be translated with the default rule.  A
principal with a second component of <code>admin</code> will become its first
component.  <code>root</code> will be used as the local name for any
principal with a second component of <code>root</code>.  The exception to
these two rules are any principals johndoe/*, which will
always get the local name <code>guest</code>.

</dl>
