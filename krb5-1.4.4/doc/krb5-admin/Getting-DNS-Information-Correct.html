<h3 class="section">Getting DNS Information Correct</h3>

<p>Several aspects of Kerberos rely on name service.  In order for Kerberos
to provide its high level of security, it is less forgiving of name
service problems than some other parts of your network.  It is important
that your Domain Name System (DNS) entries and your hosts have the
correct information.

<p>Each host's canonical name must be the fully-qualified host name
(including the domain), and each host's IP address must reverse-resolve
to the canonical name.

<p>Other than the <code>localhost</code> entry, make all entries in each
machine's <code>/etc/hosts</code> file in the following form:

<pre class="smallexample">     IP address      fully-qualified hostname        aliases
     </pre>

<p>Here is a sample <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:

<pre class="smallexample">     # this is a comment
     127.0.0.1       localhost localhost@mit.edu
     10.0.0.6       daffodil.mit.edu trillium wake-robin
     </pre>

<p>Additionally, on Solaris machines, you need to be sure the "hosts"
entry in the file <br> <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> includes the source
"dns" as well as "file".

<p>Finally, each host's keytab file must include a host/key pair for the
host's canonical name.  You can list the keys in a keytab file by
issuing the command <code>klist -k</code>.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     viola# klist -k
     Keytab name: /etc/krb5.keytab
     KVNO Principal
     ---- ------------------------------------------------------------
        1 host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     </pre>

<p>If you telnet to the host with a fresh credentials cache (ticket file),
and then <code>klist</code>, the host's service principal should be
<i>host/fully-qualified-hostname@REALM_NAME</i>.
