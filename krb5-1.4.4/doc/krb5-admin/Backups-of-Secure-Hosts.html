<h2 class="chapter">Backups of Secure Hosts</h2>

<p>When you back up a secure host, you should exclude the host's keytab
file from the backup.  If someone obtained a copy of the keytab from a
backup, that person could make any host masquerade as the host whose
keytab was compromised.  This could be particularly dangerous if the
compromised keytab was from one of your KDCs.  If the machine has a disk
crash and the keytab file is lost, it is easy to generate another keytab
file.  (See <a href="Adding-Principals-to-Keytabs.html#Adding%20Principals%20to%20Keytabs">Adding Principals to Keytabs</a>.)  If you are unable to
exclude particular files from backups, you should ensure that the
backups are kept as secure as the host's root password.
