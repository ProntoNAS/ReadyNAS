<h2 class="chapter">Upgrading Client machines</h2>

<p>Install Kerberos V5 on each client machine, according to the
instructions in the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide.

<p>Tell your users to add the appropriate directory to their paths.  On
UNIX machines, this will probably be <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.

<p>Note that if you upgrade your client machines before all of your
application servers are upgraded, your users will need to use the
Kerberos V4 programs to connect to application servers that are still
running Kerberos V4.  (The one exception is the UNIX version of
Kerberos V5 telnet, which can connect to a Kerberos V4 and Kerberos
V5 application servers.)  Users can use either the Kerberos V4 or
Kerberos V5 programs to connect to Kerberos V5 servers.
