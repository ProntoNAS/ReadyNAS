     ftp - ARPANET file transfer program


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> [<B>-v</B>] [<B>-d</B>] [<B>-i</B>] [<B>-n</B>] [<B>-g</B>] [<B>-k</B> <I>realm</I>] [<B>-f</B>] [<B>-x</B>] [<B>-u</B>]  [<B>-t</B>]
     [<I>host</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>FTP</B> is the user  interface  to  the  ARPANET  standard  File
     Transfer  Protocol.   The  program allows a user to transfer
     files to and from a remote network site.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the com-
     mand interpreter.

     -<B>v</B>   Verbose option forces <B>ftp</B> to show  all  responses  from
          the  remote  server, as well as report on data transfer
          statistics.

     -<B>n</B>   Restrains <B>ftp</B> from attempting ``auto-login'' upon  ini-
          tial  connection.   If  auto-login is enabled, <B>ftp</B> will
          check the .<I>netrc</I> (see below) file in  the  user's  home
          directory  for  an  entry  describing an account on the
          remote machine.  If no entry exists,  <B>ftp</B>  will  prompt
          for  the remote machine login name (default is the user
          identity on the  local  machine),  and,  if  necessary,
          prompt  for  a  password  and  an account with which to
          login.

     -<B>u</B>   Restrains <B>ftp</B> from  attempting  ``auto-authentication''
          upon  initial  connection.   If  auto-authentication is
          enabled, <B>ftp</B> attempts to authenticate to the FTP server
          by  sending the AUTH command, using whichever authenti-
          cation types are locally supported.  Once an  authenti-
          cation  type  is  accepted,  an authentication protocol
          will proceed by issuing  ADAT  commands.   This  option
          also disables auto-login.

     -<B>i</B>   Turns off interactive prompting  during  multiple  file
          transfers.

     -<B>d</B>   Enables debugging.

     -<B>g</B>   Disables file name globbing.

     <B>-k</B> <I>realm</I>
          When using Kerberos v4 authentication, gets tickets  in
          <I>realm</I>.

     -<B>f</B>   Causes credentials to be forwarded to the remote host.

     -<B>x</B>   Causes the client to attempt  to  negotiate  encryption
          (data   and   command  protection  levels  ``private'')
          immediately after successfully authenticating.

     -<B>t</B>   Enables packet tracing.


</PRE>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
     The client host with which <B>ftp</B>  is  to  communicate  may  be
     specified  on  the  command line.  If this is done, <B>ftp</B> will
     immediately attempt to establish  a  connection  to  an  FTP
     server  on  that host; otherwise, <B>ftp</B> will enter its command
     interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When  <B>ftp</B>
     is  awaiting  commands  from the user the prompt ``ftp&gt;'' is
     provided to the user.  The following commands are recognized
     by <B>ftp</B>:

     <B>!</B> [<I>command</I>] [<I>args</I>]]
          Invoke an interactive shell on the local  machine.   If
          there are arguments, the first is taken to be a command
          to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments  as
          its arguments.

     <B>$</B> <I>macro</I>-<I>name</I> [<I>args</I>]
          Execute the macro <I>macro</I>-<I>name</I> that was defined with  the
          <B>macdef</B>  command.   Arguments  are  passed  to the macro
          unglobbed.

     <B>account</B> [<I>passwd</I>]
          Supply a supplemental password  required  by  a  remote
          system  for  access  to resources once a login has been
          successfully completed.  If no  argument  is  included,
          the  user will be prompted for an account password in a
          non-echoing input mode.

     <B>append</B> <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Append a local file to a file on  the  remote  machine.
          If <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> is left unspecified, the local file name
          is used in naming the remote file after  being  altered
          by  any <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> setting.  File transfer uses the
          current settings for <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B>.

     <B>ascii</B>
          Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to network ASCII .  This  is
          the default type.

     <B>bell</B> Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer
          command is completed.

     <B>binary</B>
          Set the file  transfer  <B>type</B>  to  support  binary  file
          transfer.

     <B>bye</B>  Terminate the FTP session with the  remote  server  and
          exit  <B>ftp</B>.  An end of file will also terminate the ses-
          sion and exit.

     <B>case</B> Toggle remote computer file name  case  mapping  during
          <B>mget</B>  commands.   When  <B>case</B>  is  on  (default is off),
          remote computer file names with all  letters  in  upper
          case  are  written  in  the  local  directory  with the
          letters mapped to lower case.

     <B>ccc</B>  Turn off integrity protection on the  command  channel.
          This command must be sent integrity protected, and must
          be proceeded by a successful ADAT command.  Since turn-
          ing  off  integrity  protection  potentially  allows an
          attacker to insert commands onto the  command  channel,
          some FTP servers may refuse to honor this command.

     <B>cd</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>
          Change the working directory on the remote  machine  to
          <I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>.

     <B>cdup</B> Change the remote  machine  working  directory  to  the
          parent of the current remote machine working directory.

     <B>chmod</B> <I>mode</I> <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>
          Change the permission modes of the  file  <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>  on
          the remote system to <I>mode</I>.

     <B>clear</B>
          Set  the  protection  level  on   data   transfers   to
          ``clear''.   If no ADAT command succeeded, then this is
          the default protection level.

     <B>close</B>
          Terminate the FTP session with the remote  server,  and
          return  to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros
          are erased.

     <B>cprotect</B> [<I>protection</I>-<I>level</I>]
          Set the protection level  on  commands  to  <I>protection</I>-
          <I>level</I>.   The  valid protection levels are ``clear'' for
          unprotected commands, ``safe'' for  commands  integrity
          protected  by  cryptographic  checksum, and ``private''
          for commands confidentiality and integrity protected by
          encryption.   If  an  ADAT  command succeeded, then the
          default command protection level is ``safe'', otherwise
          the  only  possible level is ``clear''.  If no level is
          specified, the  current  level  is  printed.   <B>cprotect</B>
          <B>clear</B> is equivalent to the <B>ccc</B> command.

     <B>cr</B>   Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
          retrieval.    Records   are   denoted   by  a  carriage
          return/linefeed  sequence  during   ascii   type   file
          transfer.   When  <B>cr</B>  is  on  (the  default),  carriage
          returns are stripped from this sequence to conform with
          the  UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.  Records on
          non-UNIX remote systems may contain  single  linefeeds;
          when  an  ascii  type transfer is made, these linefeeds
          may be distinguished from a record delimiter only  when
          <B>cr</B> is off.

     <B>delete</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>
          Delete the file <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>debug</B> [<I>debug</I>-<I>value</I>]
          Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional  <I>debug</I>-<I>value</I>  is
          specified  it is used to set the debugging level.  When
          debugging is on, <B>ftp</B> prints each command  sent  to  the
          remote machine, preceded by the string `--&gt;'

     <B>dir</B> [<I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>] [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Print a listing of the directory contents in the direc-
          tory,  <I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>,  and,  optionally, placing the
          output in <I>local</I>-<I>file</I>.  If interactive prompting is  on,
          <B>ftp</B>  will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
          ment is indeed the target local file for receiving  <B>dir</B>
          output.   If  no  directory  is  specified, the current
          working directory on the remote machine is used.  If no
          local  file  is specified, or <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> is `<B>-</B>', output
          comes to the terminal.

     <B>disconnect</B>
          A synonym for <I>close</I>.

     <B>form</B> <I>format</I>
          Set the file transfer <B>form</B> to <I>format</I>.  The default for-
          mat is ``file''.

     <B>get</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Retrieve the file <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> and store it on the local
          machine.   If  the local file name is not specified, it
          is given the same name it has on  the  remote  machine,
          subject  to alteration by the current <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, and
          <B>nmap</B> settings.  The current settings  for  <B>type</B>,  <B>form</B>,
          <B>mode</B>,  and  <B>structure</B>  are  used while transferring the
          file.

     <B>glob</B> Toggle filename expansion for <B>mdelete</B>, <B>mget</B>, and  <B>mput</B>.
          If  globbing  is  turned  off  with <B>glob</B>, the file name
          arguments are taken literally and not expanded.   Glob-
          bing  for  <B>mput</B>  is done as in <B>csh(1)</B>.  For <B>mdelete</B> and
          <B>mget</B>, each remote file name is expanded  separately  on
          the  remote  machine  and  the  lists  are  not merged.
          Expansion of a directory name is likely to be different
          from  expansion  of  the  name of an ordinary file: the
          exact result depends on the  foreign  operating  system
          and  ftp  server,  and  can  be previewed by doing `mls
          remote-files -' Note:  <B>mget</B> and <B>mput</B> are not  meant  to
          transfer  entire directory subtrees of files.  That can
          be done by transferring a <B>tar(1)</B> archive of the subtree
          (in binary mode).

     <B>hash</B> Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each  data  block
          transferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     <B>help</B> [<I>command</I>]
          Print an informative message about the meaning of  <I>com-</I>
          <I>mand</I>.   If  no  argument is given, <B>ftp</B> prints a list of
          the known commands.

     <B>idle</B> [<I>seconds</I>]
          Set the  inactivity  timer  on  the  remote  server  to
          <I>seconds</I>  seconds.   If  <I>seconds</I> is omitted, the current
          inactivity timer is printed.

     <B>lcd</B> [<I>directory</I>]
          Change the working directory on the local machine.   If
          no <I>directory</I> is specified, the user's home directory is
          used.

     <B>ls</B> [<I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>] [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Print a listing of the contents of a directory  on  the
          remote  machine.   The  listing  includes  any  system-
          dependent  information  that  the  server  chooses   to
          include;  for  example,  most UNIX systems will produce
          output from the command `ls -l'.  (See also <B>nlist</B>.)  If
          <I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I> is left unspecified, the current work-
          ing directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on,
          <B>ftp</B>  will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
          ment is indeed the target local file for  receiving  <B>ls</B>
          output.   If  no  local file is specified, or if <I>local</I>-
          <I>file</I> is `<B>-</B>', the output is sent to the terminal.

     <B>macdef</B><I>macro</I>-<I>name</I>
          Define a macro.  Subsequent lines  are  stored  as  the
          macro  <I>macro</I>-<I>name</I>;  a  null  line  (consecutive newline
          characters in a file or carriage returns from the  ter-
          minal)  terminates  macro input mode.  There is a limit
          of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in  all  defined
          macros.  Macros remain defined until a <B>close</B> command is
          executed.  The macro processor interprets `$'  and  `\'
          as  special characters.  A `$' followed by a number (or
          numbers) is replaced by the corresponding  argument  on
          the  macro  invocation command line.  A `$' followed by
          an `i' signals that macro processor that the  executing
          macro  is  to  be  looped.   On  the first pass `$i' is
          replaced by the first argument on the macro  invocation
          command  line, on the second pass it is replaced by the
          second argument, and so on.   A  `\'  followed  by  any
          character  is  replaced by that character.  Use the `\'
          to prevent special treatment of the `$'.

     <B>mdelete</B> [<I>remote</I>-<I>files</I>]
          Delete <I>remote</I>-<I>files</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>mdir</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>files</I> <I>local</I>-<I>file</I>
          Like <B>dir</B>, except multiple remote files  may  be  speci-
          fied.   If interactive prompting is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt
          the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the
          target local file for receiving <B>mdir</B> output.

     <B>mget</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>files</I>
          Expand the <I>remote</I>-<I>files</I> on the remote machine and do  a
          <B>get</B>  for  each  file  name thus produced.  See <B>glob</B> for
          details on  the  filename  expansion.   Resulting  file
          names will then be processed according to <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>,
          and <B>nmap</B> settings.   Files  are  transferred  into  the
          local working directory, which can be changed with `lcd
          directory'; new local directories can be  created  with
          `! mkdir directory'.

     <B>mkdir</B> <I>directory</I>-<I>name</I>
          Make a directory on the remote machine.

     <B>mls</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>files</I> <I>local</I>-<I>file</I>
          Like <B>nlist</B>, except multiple remote files may be  speci-
          fied,   and  the  <I>local</I>-<I>file</I>  must  be  specified.   If
          interactive prompting is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt  the  user
          to  verify  that the last argument is indeed the target
          local file for receiving <B>mls</B> output.

     <B>mode</B> [<I>mode</I>-<I>name</I>]
          Set the file transfer <B>mode</B> to <I>mode</I>-<I>name</I>.   The  default
          mode is ``stream'' mode.

     <B>modtime</B> <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>
          Show the last modification time  of  the  file  on  the
          remote machine.

     <B>mput</B> <I>local</I>-<I>files</I>
          Expand wild cards in the list of local files  given  as
          arguments  and  do a <B>put</B> for each file in the resulting
          list.  See <B>glob</B>  for  details  of  filename  expansion.
          Resulting  file  names will then be processed according
          to <B>ntrans</B> and <B>nmap</B> settings.

     <B>newer</B> <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>
          Get the file only  if  the  modification  time  of  the
          remote file is more recent that the file on the current
          system.  If the file does not exist on the current sys-
          tem,  the  remote file is considered <B>newer</B>.  Otherwise,
          this command is identical to <B>get</B>.

     <B>nlist</B> [<I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I>] [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Print a list of the files in a directory on the  remote
          machine.   If <I>remote</I>-<I>directory</I> is left unspecified, the
          current working  directory  is  used.   If  interactive
          prompting  is  on,  <B>ftp</B>  will prompt the user to verify
          that the last argument is indeed the target local  file
          for receiving <B>nlist</B> output.  If no local file is speci-
          fied, or if <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> is `<B>-</B>', the output  is  sent  to
          the terminal.

     <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I> <I>outpattern</I>]
          Set or unset the filename  mapping  mechanism.   If  no
          arguments are specified, the filename mapping mechanism
          is unset.  If arguments are specified, remote filenames
          are mapped during <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands issued
          without a specified remote target filename.   If  argu-
          ments  are specified, local filenames are mapped during
          <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands issued without a  speci-
          fied  local  target  filename.   This command is useful
          when connecting to non-UNIX remote computer  with  dif-
          ferent  file naming conventions or practices.  The map-
          ping follows the pattern set by <I>inpattern</I>  and  <I>outpat-</I>
          <I>tern</I>.  [<I>Inpattern</I>] is a template for incoming filenames
          (which may have already been processed according to the
          <B>ntrans</B>  and  <B>case</B>  settings).   Variable  templating is
          accomplished by including  the  sequences  `$1',  `$2',
          ...,  `$9'  in <I>inpattern</I>.  Use `\' to prevent this spe-
          cial treatment of the `$' character.  All other charac-
          ters  are  treated literally, and are used to determine
          the <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I>]  variable  values.   For  example,
          given   <I>inpattern</I>   $1.$2  and  the  remote  file  name
          "mydata.data", $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2
          would have the value "data".  The <I>outpattern</I> determines
          the resulting mapped  filename.   The  sequences  `$1',
          `$2', <I>inpattern</I> template.  The sequence `$0' is replace
          by the original filename.  Additionally,  the  sequence
          `[<I>seq1</I>,  <I>seq2</I>]'  is replaced by [<I>seq1</I>] if <I>seq1</I> is not a
          null string; otherwise it is  replaced  by  <I>seq2</I>.   For
          example, the command

               nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

          would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input
          filenames    "myfile.data"    and    "myfile.data.old",
          "myfile.file" for  the  input  filename  "myfile",  and
          "myfile.myfile"   for  the  input  filename  ".myfile".
          Spaces  may  be  included  in  <I>outpattern</I>,  as  in  the
          example:  `nmap  $1  sed  "s/ *$//" &gt; $1'.  Use the `\'
          character  to  prevent   special   treatment   of   the
          `$','[',']', and `,' characters.

     <B>ntrans</B> [<I>inchars</I> [<I>outchars</I>]]
          Set or unset the filename character translation mechan-
          ism.  If no arguments are specified, the filename char-
          acter translation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are
          specified,   characters   in   remote   filenames   are
          translated during <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands issued
          without  a  specified remote target filename.  If argu-
          ments are specified, characters in local filenames  are
          translated during <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands issued
          without a specified local target filename.   This  com-
          mand  is  useful  when  connecting to a non-UNIX remote
          computer with  different  file  naming  conventions  or
          practices.  Characters in a filename matching a charac-
          ter in <I>inchars</I>  are  replaced  with  the  corresponding
          character  in <I>outchars</I>.  If the character's position in
          <I>inchars</I> is longer than  the  length  of  <I>outchars</I>,  the
          character is deleted from the file name.

     <B>open</B> <I>host</I> [<I>port</I>] [<B>-forward</B>]
          Establish  a  connection  to  the  specified  <I>host</I>  FTP
          server.   An  optional  port number may be supplied, in
          which case, <B>ftp</B> will attempt to contact an  FTP  server
          at  that  port.   If the <B>auto-authenticate</B> option is on
          (default), <B>ftp</B> will attempt to authenticate to the  FTP
          server  by  sending  the  AUTH command, using whichever
          authentication types which are locally supported.  Once
          an  authentication  type is accepted, an authentication
          protocol will proceed by issuing ADAT commands.  If the
          <B>auto-login</B>  option  is  on  (default),  <B>ftp</B>  will  also
          attempt to automatically log the user  in  to  the  FTP
          server  (see  below).  If the -<B>forward</B> option is speci-
          fied, <B>ftp</B> will forward a copy of  the  user's  Kerberos
          tickets to the remote host.

     <B>passive</B>
          Toggle passive data transfer mode.   In  passive  mode,
          the  client  initiates the data connection by listening
          on the data port.  Passive mode may  be  necessary  for
          operation  from  behind  firewalls  which do not permit
          incoming connections.

     <B>private</B>
          Set  the  protection  level  on   data   transfers   to
          ``private''.   Data  transmissions  are confidentiality
          and integrity protected by encryption.  If no ADAT com-
          mand   succeeded,  then  the  only  possible  level  is
          ``clear''.

     <B>prompt</B>
          Toggle interactive  prompting.   Interactive  prompting
          occurs during multiple file transfers to allow the user
          to selectively retrieve or store files.   If  prompting
          is  turned  off  (default is on), any <B>mget</B> or <B>mput</B> will
          transfer all files, and any  <B>mdelete</B>  will  delete  all
          files.

     <B>protect</B> [<I>protection</I>-<I>level</I>]
          Set  the  protection  level  on   data   transfers   to
          <I>protection</I>-<I>level</I>.   The  valid  protection  levels  are
          ``clear'' for unprotected data transmissions,  ``safe''
          for  data  transmissions integrity protected by crypto-
          graphic checksum, and ``private''  for  data  transmis-
          sions   confidentiality   and  integrity  protected  by
          encryption.  If no ADAT  command  succeeded,  then  the
          only  possible  level  is  ``clear''.   If  no level is
          specified, the current level is printed.   The  default
          protection level is ``clear''.

     <B>proxy</B> <I>ftp</I>-<I>command</I>
          Execute an ftp command on a secondary  control  connec-
          tion.   This  command allows simultaneous connection to
          two remote ftp servers for transferring  files  between
          the  two servers.  The first <B>proxy</B> command should be an
          <B>open</B> <B>,</B> to establish the secondary  control  connection.
          Enter  the  command "proxy ?" to see other ftp commands
          executable on the secondary connection.  The  following
          commands  behave  differently  when  prefaced by <B>proxy</B>:
          <B>open</B> will not define new macros during  the  auto-login
          process,  <B>close</B>  will  not erase existing macro defini-
          tions, <B>get</B> and <B>mget</B> transfer files from the host on the
          primary control connection to the host on the secondary
          control connection, and <B>put</B>, <B>mput</B>, and <B>append</B>  transfer
          files from the host on the secondary control connection
          to the host on the primary control  connection.   Third
          party  file  transfers  depend  upon support of the ftp
          protocol PASV command by the server  on  the  secondary
          control connection.

     <B>put</B> <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Store a local file on the remote machine.   If  <I>remote</I>-
          <I>file</I>  is  left unspecified, the local file name is used
          after processing according to any <B>ntrans</B> or  <B>nmap</B>  set-
          tings  in  naming  the remote file.  File transfer uses
          the current settings for <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>struc-</B>
          <B>ture</B>.

     <B>pwd</B>  Print the name of the current working directory on  the
          remote machine.

     <B>quit</B> A synonym for <B>bye</B>.
     <B>quote</B> <I>arg1</I> [<I>arg2</I>] [...]
          The arguments specified  are  sent,  verbatim,  to  the
          remote FTP server.

     <B>recv</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          A synonym for get.

     <B>reget</B> <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>local</I>-<I>file</I>]
          Reget acts like get, except that if  <I>local</I>-<I>file</I>  exists
          and is smaller than <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>, <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> is presumed
          to be a partially transferred copy of  <I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>  and
          the  transfer  is  continued from the apparent point of
          failure.  This command is useful when transferring very
          large  files  over  networks that are prone to dropping
          connections.

     <B>remotehelp</B> [<I>command</I>-<I>name</I>]
          Request  help  from  the  remote  FTP  server.   If   a
          <I>command</I>-<I>name</I>  is specified it is supplied to the server
          as well.

     <B>remotestatus</B> [<I>file</I>-<I>name</I>]
          With no arguments, show status of remote  machine.   If
          <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>  is  specified,  show  status of <I>file</I>-<I>name</I> on
          remote machine.

     <B>rename</B> [<I>from</I>] [<I>to</I>]
          Rename the file <I>from</I> on the remote machine, to the file
          <I>to</I>.

     <B>reset</B>
          Clear  reply  queue.   This   command   re-synchronizes
          command/reply  sequencing  with  the remote ftp server.
          Resynchronization may be necessary following  a  viola-
          tion of the ftp protocol by the remote server.

     <B>restart</B> <I>marker</I>
          Restart the immediately following <B>get</B>  or  <B>put</B>  at  the
          indicated <I>marker</I>.  On UNIX systems, marker is usually a
          byte offset into the file.

     <B>rmdir</B> <I>directory</I>-<I>name</I>
          Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     <B>runique</B>
          Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique
          filenames.   If a file already exists with a name equal
          to the target local filename for a <B>get</B> or <B>mget</B> command,
          a  ".1" is appended to the name.  If the resulting name
          matches another existing file, a ".2"  is  appended  to
          the  original  name.   If  this process continues up to
          ".99", an error message is printed,  and  the  transfer
          does  not  take  place.   The generated unique filename
          will be reported.  Note that <B>runique</B>  will  not  affect
          local files generated from a shell command (see below).
          The default value is off.

     <B>safe</B> Set the protection level on data transfers to ``safe''.
          Data  transmissions  are integrity-protected by crypto-
          graphic checksum.  If no ADAT command  succeeded,  then
          the only possible level is ``clear''.

     <B>send</B> <I>local</I>-<I>file</I> [<I>remote</I>-<I>file</I>]
          A synonym for put.

     <B>sendport</B>
          Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, <B>ftp</B>  will
          attempt  to use a PORT command when establishing a con-
          nection for each data transfer.  The use of  PORT  com-
          mands  can prevent delays when performing multiple file
          transfers.  If the PORT command fails, <B>ftp</B> will use the
          default  data  port.   When the use of PORT commands is
          disabled, no attempt will be made to use PORT  commands
          for each data transfer.  This is useful for certain FTP
          implementations which  do  ignore  PORT  commands  but,
          incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     <B>site</B> <I>arg1</I> [<I>arg2</I>] [...]
          The arguments specified  are  sent,  verbatim,  to  the
          remote FTP server as a SITE command.

     <B>size</B> <I>file</I>-<I>name</I>
          Return size of <I>file</I>-<I>name</I> on remote machine.

     <B>status</B>
          Show the current status of <B>ftp</B>.

     <B>struct</B> <I>struct</I>-<I>name</I>
          Set the file transfer  <I>structure</I>  to  <I>struct</I>-<I>name</I>.   By
          default ``stream'' structure is used.

     <B>sunique</B>
          Toggle storing of files on remote machine under  unique
          file  names.  Remote ftp server must support ftp proto-
          col STOU command for successful completion.  The remote
          server will report unique name.  Default value is off.

     <B>system</B>
          Show the type of operating system running on the remote
          machine.

     <B>tenex</B>
          Set the file transfer type to that needed  to  talk  to
          TENEX machines.

     <B>trace</B>
          Toggle packet tracing.

     <B>type</B> [<I>type</I>-<I>name</I>]
          Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to <I>type</I>-<I>name</I>.  If no type is
          specified,  the  current  type is printed.  The default
          type is network ASCII.

     <B>umask</B> [<I>newmask</I>]
          Set the default umask on the remote server to  <I>newmask</I>.
          If <I>newmask</I> is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     <B>user</B> <I>user</I>-<I>name</I> [<I>password</I>] [<I>account</I>]
          Identify yourself to the remote  FTP  server.   If  the
          <I>password</I>  is  not specified and the server requires it,
          <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user for it (after disabling  local
          echo).   If  an <I>account</I> field is not specified, and the
          FTP server requires it, the user will be  prompted  for
          it.   If an <I>account</I> field is specified, an account com-
          mand will be relayed to the  remote  server  after  the
          login  sequence  is  completed if the remote server did
          not require it for logging in.  Unless <B>ftp</B>  is  invoked
          with  ``auto-login''  disabled,  this  process  is done
          automatically on initial connection to the FTP server.

     <B>verbose</B>
          Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose  mode,  all  responses
          from  the  FTP  server  are  displayed to the user.  In
          addition, if verbose is on, when a file  transfer  com-
          pletes,  statistics  regarding  the  efficiency  of the
          transfer are reported.  By default, verbose is on.

      <B>?</B> <B>[</B><I>command</I><B>]</B>
          A synonym for help.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may  be  quoted
     with quote `"' marks.


</PRE>
<H2>ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER</H2><PRE>
     To abort a file transfer, use  the  terminal  interrupt  key
     (usually  Ctrl-C).   Sending  transfers  will be immediately
     halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending a FTP
     protocol  ABOR  command to the remote server, and discarding
     any further data received.   The  speed  at  which  this  is
     accomplished  depends  upon  the remote server's support for
     ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not support  the
     ABOR  command,  an  `ftp&gt;'  prompt will not appear until the
     remote server has completed sending the requested file.

     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when <B>ftp</B>
     has  completed  any local processing and is awaiting a reply
     from the remote server.  A  long  delay  in  this  mode  may
     result  from  the  ABOR  processing described above, or from
     unexpected behavior by the remote server,  including  viola-
     tions  of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from unex-
     pected remote server behavior, the local <B>ftp</B> program must be
     killed by hand.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</H2><PRE>
     Files specified as arguments to <B>ftp</B> commands  are  processed
     according to the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `<B>-</B>' is specified, <I>stdin</I> (for  reading)
          or <I>stdout</I> (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file  name  is  `|',  the
          remainder  of  the  argument  is interpreted as a shell
          command.  <B>Ftp</B> then forks a shell, using  <B>popen(3)</B>  with
          the  argument  supplied,  and  reads  from  (writes to)
          stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes  spaces,
          the  argument  must  be quoted; e.g.  ``" ls -lt"''.  A
          particularly  useful  example  of  this  mechanism  is:
          ``dir more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing''  is  enabled,
          local  file  names  are expanded according to the rules
          used in <B>csh(1)</B>; c.f. the <B>glob</B> command.  If the <B>ftp</B> com-
          mand expects a single local file (.e.g.  <B>put</B>), only the
          first filename generated by the ``globbing''  operation
          is used.

     4.   For <B>mget</B> commands and  <B>get</B>  commands  with  unspecified
          local  file  names,  the  local  filename is the remote
          filename, which may be altered by a  <B>case</B>,  <B>ntrans</B>,  or
          <B>nmap</B>  setting.   The  resulting  filename  may  then be
          altered if <B>runique</B> is on.

     5.   For <B>mput</B> commands and  <B>put</B>  commands  with  unspecified
          remote  file  names,  the  remote filename is the local
          filename, which may be altered by a <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> set-
          ting.   The  resulting  filename may then be altered by
          the remote server if <B>sunique</B> is on.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The FTP specification specifies many  parameters  which  may
     affect  a  file transfer.  The <B>type</B> may be one of ``ascii'',
     ``image'' (binary),  ``ebcdic'',  and  ``local  byte  size''
     (mostly  for PDP-10's and PDP-20's).  <B>Ftp</B> supports the ascii
     and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for
     <B>tenex</B> mode transfers.

     <B>Ftp</B> supports only the default values for the remaining  file
     transfer parameters:  <B>mode</B>, <B>form</B>, and <B>struct</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>THE .netrc FILE</H2><PRE>
     The .<I>netrc</I> file contains login and  initialization  informa-
     tion  used  by  the  auto-login  process.  It resides in the
     user's home directory.  The following tokens are recognized;
     they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or new-lines:

     <B>machine</B> <I>name</I>
          Identify a remote machine <I>name</I>.  The auto-login process
          searches  the  .<I>netrc</I>  file  for  a  <B>machine</B> token that
          matches the remote machine specified on the <B>ftp</B> command
          line  or  as an <B>open</B> command argument.  Once a match is
          made, the subsequent .<I>netrc</I> tokens are processed, stop-
          ping when the end of file is reached or another <B>machine</B>
          or a <B>default</B> token is encountered.

     <B>default</B>
          This is the same as <B>machine</B> <I>name</I>  except  that  <B>default</B>
          matches any name.  There can be only one <B>default</B> token,
          and it must be after all <B>machine</B> tokens.  This is  nor-
          mally used as:

               default login anonymous password user@site

          thereby giving the user <I>automatic</I> anonymous  ftp  login
          to machines not specified in .<I>netrc</I>.  This can be over-
          ridden by using the -<B>n</B> flag to disable auto-login.

     <B>login</B> <I>name</I>
          Identify a user on the remote machine.  If  this  token
          is  present,  the  auto-login  process  will initiate a
          login using the specified <I>name</I>.

     <B>password</B> <I>string</I>
          Supply a password.   If  this  token  is  present,  the
          auto-login  process will supply the specified string if
          the remote server requires a password as  part  of  the
          login  process.   Note that if this token is present in
          the .<I>netrc</I> file for any user other than <I>anonymous</I>,  <B>ftp</B>
          will  abort  the  auto-login  process  if the .<I>netrc</I> is
          readable by anyone besides the user.

     <B>account</B> <I>string</I>
          Supply an additional account password.  If  this  token
          is  present,  the  auto-login  process  will supply the
          specified string if the remote server requires an addi-
          tional account password, or the auto-login process will
          initiate an ACCT command if it does not.

     <B>macdef</B> <I>name</I>
          Define a macro.  This token functions like the <B>ftp</B> <B>mac-</B>
          <B>def</B>  command  functions.   A  macro is defined with the
          specified name; its contents begin with the next .<I>netrc</I>
          line  and  continue until a null line (consecutive new-
          line characters) is encountered.  If a macro named <B>init</B>
          is  defined,  it  is automatically executed as the last
          step in the auto-login process.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <B>Ftp</B> utilizes the following environment variables.

     HOME For default location of a .<I>netrc</I> file, if one exists.

     SHELL
          For default shell.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Correct execution  of  many  commands  depends  upon  proper
     behavior by the remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the  4.2BSD
     ascii-mode  transfer  code has been corrected.  This correc-
     tion may result in incorrect transfers of  binary  files  to
     and  from  4.2BSD  servers using the ascii type.  Avoid this
     problem by using the binary image type.
