<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>kinit</I> obtains and caches an initial  ticket-granting  ticket
     for  <I>principal</I>.<I>The</I>typical<I>default</I>behavior Kerberos 5 tickets.
     However, if kinit was built with both Kerberos 4 support and
     with  the  default behavior of acquiring both types of tick-
     ets, it will try to acquire both Kerberos 5 and  Kerberos  4
     by default.  Any documentation particular to Kerberos 4 does
     not apply if Kerberos 4 support was not built into kinit.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -<B>5</B>   get Kerberos 5 tickets.  This  overrides  whatever  the
          default  built-in  behavior may be.  This option may be
          used with -<B>4</B>

     -<B>4</B>   get Kerberos 4 tickets.  This  overrides  whatever  the
          default  built-in behavior may be.  This option is only
          available if kinit was built with Kerberos  4  compati-
          bility.  This option may be used with -<B>5</B>

     -<B>V</B>   display verbose output.

     <B>-l</B> <I>lifetime</I>
          requests a ticket  with  the  lifetime  <I>lifetime</I>.   The
          value  for <I>lifetime</I> must be followed immediately by one
          of the following delimiters:

             <B>s</B>  seconds
             <B>m</B>  minutes
             <B>h</B>  hours
             <B>d</B>  days

          as in "kinit -l 90m".  You cannot mix units; a value of
          `3h30m' will result in an error.

          If the -<B>l</B> option is not specified, the  default  ticket
          lifetime (configured by each site) is used.  Specifying
          a ticket lifetime longer than the maximum ticket  life-
          time (configured by each site) results in a ticket with
          the maximum lifetime.

     <B>-s</B> <I>start</I>_<I>time</I>
          requests  a  postdated  ticket,   valid   starting   at
          <I>start</I>_<I>time</I>.   Postdated  tickets  are  issued  with the
          <I>invalid</I> flag set, and need to be fed back  to  the  kdc
          before use.  (Not applicable to Kerberos 4.)

     <B>-r</B> <I>renewable</I>_<I>life</I>
          requests renewable tickets, with a  total  lifetime  of
          <I>renewable</I>_<I>life</I>.   The duration is in the same format as
          the -<B>l</B> option, with the same delimiters.  (Not applica-
          ble to Kerberos 4.)

     -<B>f</B>   request forwardable tickets.  (Not applicable  to  Ker-
          beros 4.)

     -<B>F</B>   do not request forwardable tickets.  (Not applicable to
          Kerberos 4.)

     -<B>p</B>   request proxiable tickets.  (Not applicable to Kerberos
          4.)

     -<B>P</B>   do not request proxiable tickets.  (Not  applicable  to
          Kerberos 4.)

     -<B>a</B>   request  tickets  with  the  local  address[es].   (Not
          applicable to Kerberos 4.)

     -<B>A</B>   request address-less tickets.  (Not applicable to  Ker-
          beros 4.)

     -<B>v</B>   requests that the ticket granting ticket in  the  cache
          (with  the  <I>invalid</I>  flag set) be passed to the kdc for
          validation.  If the ticket is within its requested time
          range, the cache is replaced with the validated ticket.
          (Not applicable to Kerberos 4.)

     -<B>R</B>   requests renewal of the ticket-granting  ticket.   Note
          that  an  expired ticket cannot be renewed, even if the
          ticket is still within its renewable life.  When  using
          this  option with Kerberos 4, the kdc must support Ker-
          beros 5 to Kerberos 4 ticket conversion.

     <B>-k</B> [<B>-t</B> <I>keytab</I>_<I>file</I>]
          requests a host ticket, obtained  from  a  key  in  the
          local host's <I>keytab</I> file.  The name and location of the
          keytab file may be specified with  the  -<B>t</B>  <I>keytab</I>_<I>file</I>
          option; otherwise the default name and location will be
          used.  When using this option with Kerberos 4, the  kdc
          must  support  Kerberos  5 to Kerberos 4 ticket conver-
          sion.

     <B>-c</B> <I>cache</I>_<I>name</I>
          use <I>cache</I>_<I>name</I> as the Kerberos 5  credentials  (ticket)
          cache  name  and  location; if this option is not used,
          the default cache name and location are used.

          The default credentials cache may vary between systems.
          If  the  <B>KRB5CCNAME</B>  environment  variable  is set, its
          value is used to name the default  ticket  cache.   Any
          existing  contents of the cache are destroyed by <I>kinit</I>.
          (Note: The default name for Kerberos 4 comes  from  the
          <B>KRBTKFILE</B>  environment  variable.  This option does not
          apply to Kerberos 4.)

     <B>-S</B> <I>service</I>_<I>name</I>
          specify an alternate service name to use  when  getting
          initial tickets.  (Applicable to Kerberos 5 or if using
          both Kerberos 5 and Kerberos 4 with a kdc that supports
          Kerberos 5 to Kerberos 4 ticket conversion.)


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <B>Kinit</B> uses the following environment variables:

     KRB5CCNAME      Location  of  the  Kerberos  5   credentials
                     (ticket) cache.

     KRBTKFILE      Filename  of  the  Kerberos   4   credentials
                    (ticket) cache.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     /tmp/krb5cc_[uid]  default location of  Kerberos  5  creden-
                        tials  cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of
                        the user).

     /tmp/tkt[uid]  default location of  Kerberos  4  credentials
                    cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).

     /etc/krb5.keytab
                    default location for the local host's  <B>keytab</B>
                    file.
