<h4 class="subsection">ksu</h4>

<p>The Kerberos V5 <code>ksu</code> program replaces the standard UNIX su
program.  <code>ksu</code> first authenticates you to Kerberos.  Depending on
the configuration of your system, <code>ksu</code> may ask for your Kerberos
password if authentication fails.  <em>Note that you should never type
your password if you are remotely logged in using an unencrypted
connection.</em>

<p>Once <code>ksu</code> has authenticated you, if your Kerberos principal
appears in the target's <code>.k5login</code> file (see <a href="Granting-Access-to-Your-Account.html#Granting%20Access%20to%20Your%20Account">Granting Access to Your Account</a>) or in the target's <code>.k5users</code> file (see below), it
switches your user ID to the target user ID.

<p>For example, <code>david</code> has put
<code>jennifer</code>'s Kerberos principal in his <code>.k5login</code>
file.  If <code>jennifer</code> uses <code>ksu</code> to become
<code>david</code>, the exchange would look like this.  (To
differentiate between the two shells, <code>jennifer</code>'s
prompt is represented as <code>jennifer%</code> and
<code>david</code>'s prompt is represented as
<code>david%</code>.)

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>jennifer%</b> ksu david
     <b>Account david: authorization for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU successful
     Changing uid to david (3382)
     david%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that the new shell has a copy of <code>jennifer</code>'s
tickets.  The ticket filename contains <code>david</code>'s UID
with <code>.1</code> appended to it:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>david%</b> klist
     <b>Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_3382.1
     Default principal: jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     
     Valid starting      Expires             Service principal
     07/31/04 21:53:01  08/01/04 07:52:53  krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     07/31/04 21:53:39  08/01/04 07:52:53  host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     david%</b>
     </pre>

<p>If <code>jennifer</code> had not appeared in
<code>david</code>'s <code>.k5login</code> file (and the system was
configured to ask for a password), the exchange would have looked like
this (assuming <code>david</code> has taken appropriate
precautions in protecting his password):

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>jennifer%</b> ksu david
     <b>WARNING: Your password may be exposed if you enter it here and are logged
              in remotely using an unsecure (non-encrypted) channel.
     Kerberos password for david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:</b>  <i>&lt;-  </i><code>jennifer</code><i> types the wrong password here.</i>
     <b>ksu: Password incorrect
     Authentication failed.
     jennifer%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Now, suppose <code>david</code> did not want to give
<code>jennifer</code> full access to his account, but wanted to
give her permission to list his files and use the "more" command to view
them.  He could create a <code>.k5users</code> file giving her permission to
run only those specific commands.

<p>The <code>.k5users</code> file is like the <code>.k5login</code> file, except that
each principal is optionally followed by a list of commands.  <code>ksu</code>
will let those principals execute only the commands listed, using the
<kbd>-e</kbd> option.  <code>david</code>'s <code>.k5users</code> file
might look like the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU       /bin/ls /usr/bin/more
     joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU         /bin/ls
     joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU   *
     david@EXAMPLE.COM
     </pre>

<p>The above <code>.k5users</code> file would let
<code>jennifer</code> run only the commands <code>/bin/ls</code> and
<code>/usr/bin/more</code>.  It would let <code>joeadmin</code> run only
the command <code>/bin/ls</code> if he had regular tickets, but if he had
tickets for his <code>admin</code> instance,
<code>joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</code>, he would be able
to execute any command.  The last line gives <code>david</code>
in the realm EXAMPLE.COM permission to execute any command. 
(<i>I.e.</i>, having only a Kerberos principal on a line is equivalent to
giving that principal permission to execute <code>*</code>.)  This is so that
david can allow himself to execute commands when he logs
in, using Kerberos, from a machine in the realm EXAMPLE.COM.

<p>Then, when <code>jennifer</code> wanted to list his home directory,
she would type:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>jennifer%</b> ksu david -e ls ~david
     <b>Authenticated jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     Account david: authorization for jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU for execution of
                    /bin/ls successful
     Changing uid to david (3382)
     Mail            News            Personal        misc            bin
     jennifer%</b>
     </pre>

<p>If <code>jennifer</code> had tried to give a different
command to <code>ksu</code>, it would have prompted for a password as with the
previous example.

<p>Note that unless the <code>.k5users</code> file gives the target permission to
run any command, the user must use <code>ksu</code> with the <kbd>-e</kbd>
<i>command</i> option.

<p>The <code>ksu</code> options you are most likely to use are:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>-n </kbd><i>principal</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>specifies which Kerberos principal you want to use for <code>ksu</code>. 
(<i>e.g.</i>, the user <code>joeadmin</code> might want to use his
<code>admin</code> instance.  See <a href="What-is-a-Ticket-.html#What%20is%20a%20Ticket%3f">What is a Ticket?</a>.)

     <dt><kbd>-c</kbd>
     <dd>specifies the location of your Kerberos credentials cache (ticket file).

     <dt><kbd>-k</kbd>
     <dd>tells <code>ksu</code> not to destroy your Kerberos tickets when <code>ksu</code> is
finished.

     <dt><kbd>-f</kbd>
     <dd>requests forwardable tickets.  (See <a href="Obtaining-Tickets-with-kinit.html#Obtaining%20Tickets%20with%20kinit">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</a>.)  This
is only applicable if <code>ksu</code> needs to obtain tickets.

     <dt><kbd>-l </kbd><i>lifetime</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>sets the ticket lifetime.  (See <a href="Obtaining-Tickets-with-kinit.html#Obtaining%20Tickets%20with%20kinit">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</a>.)  This is
only applicable if <code>ksu</code> needs to obtain tickets.

     <dt><kbd>-z</kbd>
     <dd>tells <code>ksu</code> to copy your Kerberos tickets only if the UID you are
switching is the same as the Kerberos primary (either yours or the one
specified by the <kbd>-n</kbd> option).

     <dt><kbd>-Z</kbd>
     <dd>tells <code>ksu</code> not to copy any Kerberos tickets to the new UID.

     <dt><kbd>-e </kbd><i>command</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>tells <code>ksu</code> to execute <i>command</i> and then exit.  See the
description of the <code>.k5users</code> file above.

     <dt><kbd>-a </kbd><i>text</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>(at the end of the command line) tells <code>ksu</code> to pass everything
after <code>-a</code> to the target shell. 
</dl>

<p>The full set of options to Kerberos V5 <code>ksu</code> are discussed
in the Reference section of this manual.  (see <a href="ksu-Reference.html#ksu%20Reference">ksu Reference</a>)
