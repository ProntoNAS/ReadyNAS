<h4 class="subsection">Granting Access to Your Account</h4>

<p>If you need to give someone access to log into your account, you can do
so through Kerberos, without telling the person your password.  Simply
create a file called <code>.k5login</code> in your home directory.  This file
should contain the Kerberos principal (See <a href="What-is-a-Kerberos-Principal-.html#What%20is%20a%20Kerberos%20Principal%3f">What is a Kerberos Principal?</a>.) of each person to whom you wish to give access.  Each
principal must be on a separate line.  Here is a sample <code>.k5login</code>
file:

<pre class="smallexample">     jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     david@EXAMPLE.COM
     </pre>

<p>This file would allow the users <code>jennifer</code> and
<code>david</code> to use your user ID, provided that they had
Kerberos tickets in their respective realms.  If you will be logging
into other hosts across a network, you will want to include your own
Kerberos principal in your <code>.k5login</code> file on each of these hosts.

<p>Using a <code>.k5login</code> file is much safer than giving out your
password, because:

     <ul>
<li>You can take access away any time simply by removing the principal
from your <code>.k5login</code> file.

     <li>Although the user has full access to your account on one
particular host (or set of hosts if your <code>.k5login</code> file is shared,
<i>e.g.</i>, over NFS), that user does not inherit your network privileges.

     <li>Kerberos keeps a log of who obtains tickets, so a system
administrator could find out, if necessary, who was capable of using
your user ID at a particular time. 
</ul>

<p>One common application is to have a <code>.k5login</code> file in
<code>root</code>'s home directory, giving root access to that machine to the
Kerberos principals listed.  This allows system administrators to allow
users to become root locally, or to log in remotely as <code>root</code>,
without their having to give out the root password, and without anyone
having to type the root password over the network.
