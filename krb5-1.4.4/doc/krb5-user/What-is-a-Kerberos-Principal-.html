<h3 class="section">What is a Kerberos Principal?</h3>

<p>A Kerberos <dfn>principal</dfn> is a unique identity to which Kerberos can
assign tickets.  Principals can have an arbitrary number of
components.  Each component is separated by a component separator,
generally `/'.  The last component is the realm, separated from the
rest of the principal by the realm separator, generally `@'.  If there
is no realm component in the principal, then it will be assumed that
the principal is in the default realm for the context in which it is
being used.

<p>Traditionally, a principal is divided into three parts:  the
<dfn>primary</dfn>, the <dfn>instance</dfn>, and the <dfn>realm</dfn>.  The format of
a typical Kerberos V5 principal is <code>primary/instance@REALM</code>.

     <ul>
<li>The <dfn>primary</dfn> is the first part of the principal.  In the case
of a user, it's the same as your username.  For a host, the primary is
the word <code>host</code>.

     <li>The <dfn>instance</dfn> is an optional string that qualifies the
primary.  The instance is separated from the primary by a slash
(<code>/</code>).  In the case of a user, the instance is usually null, but a
user might also have an additional principal, with an instance called
<code>admin</code>, which he/she uses to administrate a database.  The
principal <code>jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</code> is completely
separate from the principal
<code>jennifer/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU</code>, with a separate
password, and separate permissions.  In the case of a host, the instance
is the fully qualified hostname, e.g.,
<code>daffodil.mit.edu</code>.

     <li>The <dfn>realm</dfn> is your Kerberos realm.  In most cases, your
Kerberos realm is your domain name, in upper-case letters.  For example,
the machine <code>daffodil.example.com</code> would be in
the realm <code>EXAMPLE.COM</code>. 
</ul>
