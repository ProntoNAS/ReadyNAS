<h4 class="subsection">Overview of Additional Features</h4>

<p>The Kerberos V5 <dfn>network programs</dfn> are those programs that
connect to another host somewhere on the internet.  These programs
include <code>rlogin</code>, <code>telnet</code>, <code>ftp</code>, <code>rsh</code>,
<code>rcp</code>, and <code>ksu</code>.  These programs have all of the original
features of the corresponding non-Kerberos <code>rlogin</code>, <code>telnet</code>,
<code>ftp</code>, <code>rsh</code>, <code>rcp</code>, and <code>su</code> programs, plus
additional features that transparently use your Kerberos tickets for
negotiating authentication and optional encryption with the remote host. 
In most cases, all you'll notice is that you no longer have to type your
password, because Kerberos has already proven your identity.

<p>The Kerberos V5 network programs allow you the options of forwarding
your tickets to the remote host (if you obtained forwardable tickets
with the <code>kinit</code> program; see <a href="Obtaining-Tickets-with-kinit.html#Obtaining%20Tickets%20with%20kinit">Obtaining Tickets with kinit</a>), and
encrypting data transmitted between you and the remote host.

<p>This section of the tutorial assumes you are familiar with the
non-Kerberos versions of these programs, and highlights the Kerberos
functions added in the Kerberos V5 package.
