<h4 class="subsection">Destroying Your Tickets with kdestroy</h4>

<p>Your Kerberos tickets are proof that you are indeed yourself, and
tickets can be stolen.  If this happens, the person who has them can
masquerade as you until they expire.  For this reason, you should
destroy your Kerberos tickets when you are away from your computer.

<p>Destroying your tickets is easy.  Simply type <kbd>kdestroy</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> kdestroy
     <b>shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>If <code>kdestroy</code> fails to destroy your tickets, it will beep and give
an error message.  For example, if <code>kdestroy</code> can't find any
tickets to destroy, it will give the following message:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> kdestroy
     <b>kdestroy: No credentials cache file found while destroying cache
     shell%</b>
     </pre>
