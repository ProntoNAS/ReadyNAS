<h4 class="subsection">rlogin</h4>

<p>The Kerberos V5 <code>rlogin</code> command works exactly like the
standard UNIX rlogin program, with the following Kerberos options added:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>-f</kbd>
     <dd>forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host.

     <dt><kbd>-F</kbd>
     <dd>forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host, and marks them
re-forwardable from the remote host.

     <dt><kbd>-k </kbd><i>realm</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>requests tickets for the remote host in the specified realm, instead of
determining the realm itself.

     <dt><kbd>-x</kbd>
     <dd>encrypts the input and output data streams (the username is sent unencrypted)

</dl>

<p>For example, if <code>david</code> wanted to use the standard
UNIX rlogin to connect to the machine
<code>daffodil.example.com</code>, he would type:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> rlogin daffodil.example.com -l david
     <b>Password:</b>  <i>&lt;- david types his password here</i>

     shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that the machine
<code>daffodil.example.com</code> asked for
<code>david</code>'s password.  When he typed it, his password
was sent over the network unencrypted.  If an intruder were watching
network traffic at the time, that intruder would know
<code>david</code>'s password.

<p>If, on the other hand, <code>jennifer</code> wanted to use
Kerberos V5 rlogin to connect to the machine
<code>trillium.mit.edu</code>, she could forward a
copy of her tickets, mark them as not forwardable from the remote host,
and request an encrypted session as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> rlogin trillium.mit.edu -f -x
     <b>This rlogin session is using DES encryption for all data transmissions.

     Athena Server (sun4) Version 9.1.11 Tue Jul 30 14:40:08 EDT 2002
     shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that <code>jennifer</code>'s machine used Kerberos
to authenticate her to <code>trillium.mit.edu</code>,
and logged her in automatically as herself.  She had an encrypted
session, a copy of her tickets were waiting for her, and she never typed
her password.

<p>If you forwarded your Kerberos tickets, <code>rlogin</code> automatically
destroys them when it exits.  The full set of options to Kerberos V5
<code>rlogin</code> are discussed in the Reference section of this manual.
