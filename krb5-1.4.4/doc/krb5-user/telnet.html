<h4 class="subsection">telnet</h4>

<p>The Kerberos V5 <code>telnet</code> command works exactly like the
standard UNIX telnet program, with the following Kerberos options added:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>-f</kbd>
     <dd>forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host.

     <dt><kbd>-F</kbd>
     <dd>forwards a copy of your tickets to the remote host, and marks them
re-forwardable from the remote host.

     <dt><kbd>-k </kbd><i>realm</i><kbd></kbd>
     <dd>requests tickets for the remote host in the specified realm, instead of
determining the realm itself.

     <dt><kbd>-K</kbd>
     <dd>uses your tickets to authenticate to the remote host, but does not log
you in.

     <dt><kbd>-a</kbd>
     <dd>attempt automatic login using your tickets.  <code>telnet</code> will assume
the same username unless you explicitly specify another.

     <dt><kbd>-x</kbd>
     <dd>turns on encryption.

</dl>

<p>For example, if <code>david</code> wanted to use the standard
UNIX telnet to connect to the machine
<code>daffodil.mit.edu</code>, he would type:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> telnet daffodil.example.com
     <b>Trying 128.0.0.5 ...
     Connected to daffodil.example.com.
     Escape character is '^]'.
     
     NetBSD/i386 (daffodil) (ttyp3)
     
     login:</b> david
     <b>Password:</b>    <i>&lt;- david types his password here</i>

     shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that the machine
<code>daffodil.example.com</code> asked for
<code>david</code>'s password.  When he typed it, his password
was sent over the network unencrypted.  If an intruder were watching
network traffic at the time, that intruder would know
<code>david</code>'s password.

<p>If, on the other hand, <code>jennifer</code> wanted to use the
Kerberos V5 telnet to connect to the machine
<code>trillium.mit.edu</code>, she could forward a
copy of her tickets, request an encrypted session, and log on as herself
as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>shell%</b> telnet -a -f -x trillium.mit.edu
     <b>Trying 128.0.0.5...
     Connected to trillium.mit.edu.
     Escape character is '^]'.
     [ Kerberos V5 accepts you as ``jennifer@mit.edu'' ]
     [ Kerberos V5 accepted forwarded credentials ]
     What you type is protected by encryption.

     Athena Server (sun4) Version 9.1.11 Tue Jul 30 14:40:08 EDT 2002
     
     shell%</b>
     </pre>

<p>Note that <code>jennifer</code>'s machine used Kerberos
to authenticate her to <code>trillium.mit.edu</code>,
and logged her in automatically as herself.  She had an encrypted
session, a copy of her tickets already waiting for her, and she never
typed her password.

<p>If you forwarded your Kerberos tickets, <code>telnet</code> automatically
destroys them when it exits.  The full set of options to Kerberos V5
<code>telnet</code> are discussed in the Reference section of this manual.
