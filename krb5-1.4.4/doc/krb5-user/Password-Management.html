<h3 class="section">Password Management</h3>

<p>Your password is the only way Kerberos has of verifying your identity. 
If someone finds out your password, that person can masquerade as
you--send email that comes from you, read, edit, or delete your files,
or log into other hosts as you--and no one will be able to tell the
difference.  For this reason, it is important that you choose a good
password (see <a href="Password-Advice.html#Password%20Advice">Password Advice</a>), and keep it secret.  If you need to
give access to your account to someone else, you can do so through
Kerberos.  (See <a href="Granting-Access-to-Your-Account.html#Granting%20Access%20to%20Your%20Account">Granting Access to Your Account</a>.)  You should
<i>never</i> tell your password to anyone, including your system
administrator, for any reason.  You should change your password
frequently, particularly any time you think someone may have found out
what it is.
