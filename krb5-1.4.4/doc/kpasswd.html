<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     kpasswd - change a user's Kerberos password


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>kpasswd</B> [<I>principal</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <I>kpasswd</I> command is used to change a Kerberos principal's
     password.   <I>Kpasswd</I>  prompts  for the current Kerberos pass-
     word, which is used to obtain a <B>changepw</B> ticket from the KDC
     for  the  user's  Kerberos  realm.   If <B>kpasswd</B> successfully
     obtains the <B>changepw</B> ticket, the user is prompted twice  for
     the new password, and the password is changed.

     If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies  the
     length  and/or  number  of character classes required in the
     new password, the new password must conform to  the  policy.
     (The  five  character  classes  are  lower case, upper case,
     numbers, punctuation, and all other characters.)

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <I>principal</I>
          change the password for the Kerberos principal  <I>princi-</I>
          <I>pal</I>.   Otherwise,  the  principal  is  derived from the
          identity of the user invoking the <I>kpasswd</I> command.

                        time  of the password changing operation.
                        ([pid] is the process-ID of  the  kpasswd
                        process.)
