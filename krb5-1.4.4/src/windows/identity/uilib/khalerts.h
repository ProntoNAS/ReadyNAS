/*! \brief Display an alert

    The alert must have a valid \a severity, \a title and a \a message
    to be displayed.  Otherwise the function immediately returns with
    a failure code.

    The method used to display the alert is as follows:

    - A balloon alert will be shown if one of the following is true: 
      - The NetIDMgr application is minimized or in the background.  
      - ::KHUI_ALERT_FLAG_REQUEST_BALLOON is specified in \a flags.  
    - Otherwise an alert window will be shown.

    If the message, title of the alert is too long to fit in a balloon
    prompt, there's a suggestion or if there are custom commands then
    a placeholder balloon prompt will be shown which when clicked on,
    shows the actual alert in an alert window.  

    An exception is when ::KHUI_ALERT_FLAG_DEFACTION is specified in
    flags.  In this case instead of a placeholder balloon prompt, one
    will be shown with the actual title and message (truncated if
    necessary).  Clicking on the balloon will have the same effect as
    choosing the first command in the action.

    The placeholder balloon prompt will have a title derived from the
    first 63 characters of the \a title field in the alert and a
    message notifying the user that they should click the balloon
    prompt for more information.

    To this end, it is beneficial to limit the length of the title to
    63 characters (64 counting the terminating NULL).  This limit is
    enforced on Windows.  Also, try to make the title descriptive.

/*! \brief Lock an alert 

    Locking an alert disallows any other thread from accessing the
    alert at the same time.  NetIDMgr keeps a global list of all alert
    objects and the user interface may access any of them at various
    points in time.  Locking the alert allows a thread to modify an
    alert without causing another thread to be exposed to an
    inconsistent state.

    Once a thread obtains a lock on the alert, it must call
    khui_alert_unlock() to unlock it.  Otherwise no other thread will
    be able to access the alert.

    \note Currently the alert lock is global.  Locking one alert
        disallows access to all other alerts as well.

    \note Calling khui_alert_lock() is only necessary if you are
        modifying the ::khui_alert structure directly.  Calling any of
        the khui_alert_* functions to modify the alert does not
        require obtaining a lock, as they perform synchronization
        internally.
