<h1>Change Password</h1>

<p>The change password dialog can be invoked from the <a
href="menu_credential.htm">Credentials</a> menu.  This is used to
change the password for the primary credentials provider (currently
Kerberos 5).
</p>

<p>For the default identity provider (Kerberos 5), there are two input
boxes to specify the identity for which the password is to be changed.
The identity uniquely maps to the Kerberos principal of the same name.
Then the current password must be entered along with the new password
twice.
</p>

<p>Note that currently, when the password for an identity is being
changed, only the associated Kerberos 5 password is changed.
