<h1>NetIDMgr Concepts: Identity</h1>

<p>While there are many approaches to defining what an identity is, as
far as the NetIDMgr framework is considered, an identity is the unique
security principal that is identified by a service.  Each credential
that is managed by NetIDMgr is assumed to map to a unique identity.
The collection of credentials that map to a single identity is
considered to belong to that identity.
