<h1>New Credentials</h1>

<p>The new credentials dialog can be invoked from the <a
href="menu_credential.htm">Credentials</a> menu, by typing <span
class="pre">Ctrl + N</span>, using the context menu in the credentials
window or using the context menu in the NetIDMgr icon in the system
notification area.
</p>

<p>Once invoked, you will be presented with a dialog similar to the
following:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/screen_new_creds.bmp" alt="New credentials dialog"/>
<p class="caption">New credentials dialog with a valid identity
selected.</p> <p class="caption"><i>Note that the above screenshot is
from an instance of NetIDMgr with Kerberos 5, Kerberos 4 and OpenAFS
plugins with a Kerberos 5 identity manager.  Actual display may be
different depending on the plugins that are active.</i></p>

<p>If the Kerberos 5 identity provider is used, the dialog will ask
for a username and a realm to determine the identity for which new
credentials will be obtained for.  Depending on the selected identity,
you may be required to provide a password or other form of
authentication for new credentials to be obtained.
</p>

<p>Below the prompts is the credentials summary window.  This window
provides an overview of the credentals that will be obtained when the
dialog is completed.
</p>

<h3>Expanded view</h3>

<p>If you click any of the credentials type hyperlinks in the
credentials summary window or select the <span class="pre">Options
&gt;&gt;</span> button, the dialog will switch to the exanded view.
An example of this is shown below:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/screen_new_creds_exp.bmp"
alt="Expanded new credentials window" />

<p class="caption">Expanded view of the new credetials dialog</p>

<p>
The expanded view provides access to additional options available for
each credential provider.  For example, the Kerberos 5 credentials
provider allows you to set the lifetime of the obtained Kerberos
ticket as well as ticket flags such as <i>renewable</i> or
<i>forwardable</i>.
</p>

<h3>Credentials summary window</h3>

<p>The credentials summary window provides an overview of the
credentials that will be obtained after the successful completion of
the new credentials dialog.  The window contains hyperlinks that will
take you to the corresponding credentials option panels where you will
be able to set additional options for each type.
</p>

<p>If there is a problem with the selected identity, the credentials
window will display a message describing the problem.  For example:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/screen_new_creds_err01.bmp" alt="Credentials summary window showing an invalid identity" />
</p>

<p>
The above is an example of what you would see if the provided identity
is invalid.  Once the identity provider (in this case, Kerberos 5)
indicates that the identity is invalid, it will be displayed as above
along with a brief description of why the identity was found to be
invalid.  Here, the Kerberos 5 identity provider is reporting that the
specified principal does not exist in the Kerberos database.
</p>

<h3>Additional notes</h3>

<p>
The new credentials dialog can be invoked from the command line using
the <span class="pre"> -i </span> or <span class="pre"> --kinit
</span> command line option.  Additionally, if you specify the <span
class="pre"> -a </span> or <span class="pre"> --autoinit </span>
command line option, the new credentials dialog will be displayed if
there are no credentials available.
</p>

<p>
Setting the <span class="pre">Prompt for new credentials if there
aren't any at startup</span> option is set in the <span
class="pre">General</span> configuration panel, then the behavior is
similar to the <span class="pre">--autoinit</span> option.
