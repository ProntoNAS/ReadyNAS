<h1>Main Window</h1>

<p>The main window of Network Identity Manager is structured as follows</p>

<map id="main_wnd_map">
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "7,34,243,56" href = "menu_all.htm" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "6,56,364,90" href = "tb_standard.htm" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "6,112,613,164" href = "#cred1" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "246,162,288,197" href = "#cred2" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "72,196,107,245" href = "#credtype1" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "69,278,107,315" href = "#credtype2" />
  <area shape = "rect" coords = "236,332,294,367" href = "#cred3" />
</map>

<img src="images/screen_main_wnd.bmp" usemap="#main_wnd_map"/>

<ol>
  <li>Menu bar</li>
  <li>Tool bar</li>

  <li><a name="cred1" /> An identity with a valid Kerberos 5 initial
  ticket</li>

  <li><a name="cred2" /> An identity with valid Kerberos 5 tickets and
  AFS tokens</li> 

  <li><a name="credtype1" /> A set of Kerberos 5 tickets</li>

  <li><a name="credtype2" /> A set of AFS tokens</li>

  <li>An identity with expired Kerberos 5 tickets</li>

</ol>

<h3>Identity views</h3>

<p>
The default credentials view organizes them grouped by identity name
and then by credential type.  Each credential is then shown under each
group heading sorted by the credential name.  The default headings for
the credential view provides you with a minimal amount of information
to reduce clutter.  If you wish you can add columns to the display
using the <span class="pre">Choose columns...</span> action on the
<span class="pre"><a href="html/menu_view.htm">View</a></span> menu.
</p>

<p>
The header backgrounds and the credential rows change color if the
credentials are about to expire or are expired.  

<ul> 

<li> <span style="background-color:#fbc74d">Headers</span> mean that
credentials at that level will expire unless renewed.  Credentials
will have a warning icon next to them.<br/>

The threshold for this can be set as the <span class="pre">Warn</span>
parameter in the <span class="pre">Notifications</span> configuration
panel.</li>

<li> <span style="background-color:#f08575">Headers</span> mean that
credentials at that level will expire in a few minutes.  Credentials
will have a critical icon next to them.<br/>

The threshold for this can be set as the <span class="pre">Warn
again</span> parameter in the <span class="pre">Notifications</span>
configuration panel.  </li>

<li> <span style="background-color:#ff9090">Headers</span> mean that
the credentials at that level have expired.  Credentials will have an
expired icon next to them.<br/>

The threshold for this is always zero.
</li>

</ul>
