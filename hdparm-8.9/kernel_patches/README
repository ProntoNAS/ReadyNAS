The new "libata" SATA/IDE drivers in the Linux-2.6.xx kerrnels
did not originally support use of hdparm on ATAPI devices.

This directory includes kernel patches that can
be applied together (in sequence) to add support to
some older kernels for using hdparm with ATAPI (CD/DVD/tape) drives.

	01_libata_cmd_len_check.patch
	02_libata_atapi_ata16.patch

Both of these are required for any kernel prior to 2.6.22,
and only the second one may be needed with 2.6.23.
The 2.6.24 kernel (and beyond) does not require either patch.

There is also another patch in this directory to enable "libata"
to deal with drives that have been set for "power-up in standby"
(eg. using "hdparm -s1").  Without this patch, such drives become
expensive paperweights, at least until booted under a kernel
that has had the patch applied.  This patch is needed for all
kernels prior to 2.6.22, but not with 2.6.22 or later.
