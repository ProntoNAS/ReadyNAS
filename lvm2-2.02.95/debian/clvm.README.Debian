This is the cluster LVM daemon for LVM2.

In conjunction with the Red Hat cluster infrastructure (cman & dlm) it
will allow LVM volumes on shared storage to be managed from a central
point. If you also want to share data you should also look at GFS.

Only "normal" block devices may be shared. At present, snapshots and
mirroring are not cluster aware. So, if you want to snapshot a volume
is is VERY IMPORTANT that not only the snapshot device but also the origin
device be activated on one node only.

clvmd should be run on all nodes in the cluster, unless this is the case
commands will fail as the integrity of the LVM metadata cannot be assured.

In order to make normal lvm2 cluster-aware it is necessary to edit the
configuration file /etc/lvm/lvm.conf as follows:

in the global{} section:
  locking_type = 3
