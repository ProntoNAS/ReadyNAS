ucf (3.0029) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When asking how to handle an upodate to a locally modified
    configuration file, ucf does not tell the user where the new version
    of the configuration file lives. This makes it hard to take action
    when opening a new shell. This commit updates the debconf templates to
    include that information.  (Closes: #616486, #747295, #747299)
    (Closes: #747310, #747312, #747335, #747346, #747371, #747450)
    (Closes: #747533, #748148, #748178, #748371).
  * ucf uses getopt(1) to process command line arguments. The debug
    options take a an optional level. For short options, If the option has
    an optional argument, it must be written directly after the option
    character if present. For long options, the optional argument must be
    written directly after the long  option  name, separated by `=', if
    present. This is now documented in the manual page.
  * Document that ucf --purge can be used to make ucf forget about the
    state of the previous decisions for a configuration file, so that when
    the package is updated or reinstalled, ucf will ask again about
    disposition,  (Closes: #566277).

  * [f70b2c6]: Handle errors in three way merges This fix is one that
    was first implemented in Ubuntu, and has only been lightly modified.
    The problem was the handling of merge failures in three way merges,
    ucf used to just pass the error through to the maintainer script,
    and so a merge failure resulted in a maintainer script failure,
    which could cascade in a upgrade. However, trapping the error, and
    showing it via debconf, and then returning to the ucf debconf menu
    allows users to resolve this issue as they please. This patch
    implements that.
    Bug fix: "three-way-merge errors cause upgrade pains", thanks to Steve
    Langasek                                               (Closes: #543593).

    Closes: Bug#511893 Author: Niko Tyni <ntyni@debian.org>
  * [f5cbbdf]: Show the differences on the first try
    Until 3.0012, ucf/show_diff was reset just before showing it to the
    user. This would unset the 'seen' flag properly. However, moving the
    db_reset call after db_input made the latter skip the note on the
    first time if the 'seen' flag was already set. To make things worse,
    Debconf::ConfModule::finish() sets the 'seen' flag for all the
    questions it has handled before exiting, so the flag was always true
    after debconf exited. Simply unsetting the flag before db_input fixes
    this.

    Debconf does not use world readable "temporary internal

    Tightening the permissions on the debconf database would break

  * [debiandir:8949365] Fix VCS-Browser URL
  * [debiandir:ede9c73] Do not depend on cdebconf as an alternative
    ucf relies heavily on debconf to do its job, and thus depends on it. Way
    back when, it was told to me that we arte going to move to cdebconf,
    which at some point will be the preferred way. In the meantime, to
    facilitate the future transition, we should all depend on
       debconf | cdebconf
    to make life in the future easier.

    Now, as of version 3.005, ucf started using a feaure that has long been a
    part of cdebconf, but was only ported to debconf in version 1.5.19, so
    now ucf started depending on:
      debconf (>= 1.5.19) | cdebconf
    and this is where trouble beings.

    Suppose a machine running stable has cdebconf installed. It also has an
    old version of debconf installed, say, one that is older than
    1.5.19. Since cdebconf was installed, the dependency requirements are
    fully satisfied, so debconf was not updated.

    Now, ucf follows the instructions in debconf-devel(7) -- and that just
    uses debconf, the older version which does nothave support for the
    feature ucf needs. Boom, there goes the update.

    This is a grave bug.

ucf (3.009) unstable; urgency=low

  * There was an issue that using the sdiff or diff options of ucf would
    either error out, or would hang due to a communication snafu with
    debconf. This fix handles exceptional sizes of diff output, correcting
    both issues. This is an important bug fix meant for Lenny.
                                                   Closes: #486702, #490034
  * The current Catalan translation of UCF has a few usability problems,
    namely the same translation for all 3 different diff options. The
    result is that you are presented with the same option twice in many
    cases, and can't tell the difference between them. This i18n update
    fixes that issue.                                       Closes: #497391
  * Updated Standards-Version: No changes.

  * Of course, this did not mean that the modified column was actually
    filled with valid values: A number of places we were not using the
    proper accessor methods, which added to the confusion. Fixed.
                                                          Closes: #464238
  * Add a new --debconf-template option to specify an alternate
    caller-provided debconf template for the user prompt. Heavy lifting
    done by Steve Langasek. This was apparently done to allow grub in
    Ubuntu to manage partial file fragments.              Closes: #456241.
  * Use db_x_loadtemplatefile instead of debconf-loadtemplates for template
    loading, and depend on debconf (>= 1.5.19) | cdebconf for the
    implementation. Thanks to Steve Langasek.             Closes: #424926
  * Drop the Recommends: debconf-utils now that it's no longer used.
  * Instead of proceeding merrily on our way if the three way merge fails,
    we now leave the dest file unchanged, leave the mess in the new file
    (foo.ucf-new), tell the user about it, and abort the upgrade by
    exiting with exit 3. We still psit out an error about conflicts.
    Hopefully, this adequately resolves the bug.          Closes: #456245

ucf (3.004) unstable; urgency=high

  * For "keep current" and "threeway merge", ucf expects answers from
    debconf which differ from what is specified in the template
    master. Frans Pop suggested using the Choices-C feature of debconf,
    which is relatively new, but defines a fixed alias for each option
    which Debconf will then use in db_get and db_set operations -- so no
    more matching the template in the code. He also kindly provided a
    working patch. Updated versioned dependency on debconf to reflect the
    need for a new version.                Closes: #443179, #449274, #453084

    template master, which had been changed in the review process.  This
    fixes that bug; which made ucf mostly useless.         (Closes: #443179).

    to Gustavo Noronha Silva. Users using a Graphical frontend are
    surprised when the display apparently just blocks when they ask to see
    a diff (or 3-way diff) of the configuration file being handled, when
    actually the diff is  displayed on the terminal window ucf was run
    on. Until the debconf-escape utility and the escape CAPB support,
    db_subst ran into newline and line length issues. Patch from Michael
    Vogt.                                                 (Closes: #325576).
  * From Michael Vogt's patch: use a debconf note for the diff. updated
    dependency of debconf to 1.4.72 (this is the version that supports the
    "escape" capability)
  * Left in the debconf-2.0 as is, since I am assuming anything that
    provides debconf-2.0 should be a drop in replacement, or that should
    be considered a bug. This is a change from Michael Vogt's patch.

    however, that this merits a NEWS file: the vast majority of users who
    install ucf do so since it is pulled in as a dependency, and they
    don't care a white about ucfr being added.  The only people who might
    care are people who use ucf to manage configuration files, and that is
    a very small number.  NEWS items should be relegated to important
    information that may affect the majority of installations; and this
    does not fit the bill.

  * Bug fix: "ucf: Needs root access to display the help message", thanks
    to Frédéric Bothamy. Allow ucf to be run as non-root. This entailed
    not loading debconf related stuff, since that seems to require root
    privileges. Instead, we just emit a diagnostic and go on. Hopefully
    this is enough to let the user know when debconf does not work as
    expected. Also, if ucf is not running as root, automatically
    transition into the no-action mode, so a non-root user can still be
    able run ucf in diagnostic mode.                     (Closes: #332239).
  * Added a note to the man page that --purge does not touch the
    configuration file on disk -- cleaning that up is still the calling
    package's responsibility.

  Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  * Added debconf support to ucf. It will use debconf for prompting.
  * Since some badly behaved maintainer scripts use debconf, then cripple it
    (by calling STOP, redirecting stdio, etc), and then call ucf, ucf must
    take care to not use debconf if called from such a script. In this case it
    will fall back to prompting without using debconf, unless a --debconf-ok
    parameter is given, to let ucf know that the maintainer script
    promises it has not screwed up debconf.
  * Update ucf.1
  * Since the above hack means that ucf retains the ability to prompt
    on its own, I made it not depend on debconf at all; if debconf is not
    present then ucf will fall back to its internal prompter. closes: Bug#234151

ucf (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Urk. Major breakage in ucf on upgrade; one loses
    /var/lib/ucf/hashfile, due to a major thinko. The downside is that the
    currently installed file shall be trated as the old version, and a
    wquestion shall be asked if the upstream file is different. This bad,
    but there is no real data loss; only a potential question asked on the
    next upgrade of packages using ucf.

ucf (0.08) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add a --purge option to ucf, to remove all hints about a configuration
    file from the hashfile. This fixes what happened if a package was
    purged, and reinstalled -- on purge the configuration file was
    removed, but it was still in ucf's database. On reinstall, since the
    upstream file had not changed, ucf did not copy it to the destination
    -- even though the destination file no longer existed. This is a major
    bugfix.                                                  closes: Bug#159015
  * Fix use of md5sum files, and manpage typo, thanks to a patch from
    Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>.            closes: Bug#163229
  * ucf now has a rudimentary, experimental, and undocumented diff3
    capability. So, optionally, people can see a diff3 diff between the
    current file, the old file, and the new upstream version. Also, they
    can have the changes made in the upstream versions merged into the
    current file. This can be dangerous.

  * Added the ability for the developer to specify a single file with
    historical md5sums, instead of having to ship a directory populated
    with single line files for every configuration file in the
    package. This is now beginning to get reasonably complex ;-)
