This is my ypmake implementation; a perl script to build NIS maps.
I wrote it because the current ypMakefile is rather slow, since it
runs lots of processes and spends most of its time forking and
executing.

ypmake comes as a central perl script that loads modules when required.
It is fairly configurable, in that users can easily specify alternate
map sources, and add their own map implementation without too much
hassle.

Please let me know how you like it, and whether it works for you. I tried
to make it as general as possible, but there are a couple of Sun-centric
maps (hah, everyone *knows* that the sun orbits Linux!) like mail.aliases
and passwd.adjunct that are not yet implemented. If you implemented them,
please send me the perl module so I can add it to the distibution. Also,
the Makefile currently requires that you use GNU make.

This packages owes a lot to the work of Thorsten Kukuk
<kukuk@weber.uni-paderborn.de> who tested every version and reported
back the bugs he found.


Comments and suggestions welcome, as always.
