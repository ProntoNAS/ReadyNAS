libcgicc (3.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Repacked upstream .orig.tar.gz after running 'make distclean' on it, as
      it contained a cygwin build. Merely cleaning this during the build caused
      dpkg-buildpackage to complain of unrepresentable changes to the source.

  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.8.2 (no changes required)
  * Updated debian/compat to 7, added comma after ${shlibs:Depends} in
  	debian/control. Replaced dh_clean -k with dh_prep, updated build-dep on
    debhelper to version 7. (fixes lintian warnings)
  * Add commands to debian/rules to re-libtoolize and autoreconf the package
    (closes: #527752)
