<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Hardware issues</A></H2>

<P>This section will mention some of the hardware concerns involved when
running software RAID.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 IDE Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>It is indeed possible to run RAID over IDE disks. And excellent
performance can be achieved too. In fact, today's price on IDE drives
and controllers does make IDE something to be considered, when setting
up new RAID systems.
<UL>
<LI><B>Physical stability:</B> IDE drives has traditionally
been of lower mechanical quality than SCSI drives. Even today, the
warranty on IDE drives is typically one year, whereas it is often
three to five years on SCSI drives.  Although it is not fair to say,
that IDE drives are per definition poorly made, one should be aware
that IDE drives of <EM>some</EM> brand <EM>may</EM> fail more often
that similar SCSI drives. However, other brands use the exact same
mechanical setup for both SCSI and IDE drives. It all boils down to:
All disks fail, sooner or later, and one should be prepared for that.</LI>
<LI><B>Data integrity:</B> Earlier, IDE had no way of assuring
that the data sent onto the IDE bus would be the same as the data
actually written to the disk. This was due to total lack of parity,
checksums, etc.  With the Ultra-DMA standard, IDE drives now do a
checksum on the data they receive, and thus it becomes highly unlikely
that data get corrupted.</LI>
<LI><B>Performance:</B> I'm not going to write thoroughly about
IDE performance here. The really short story is:
<UL>
<LI>IDE drives are fast (12 MB/s and beyond)</LI>
<LI>IDE has more CPU overhead than SCSI (but who cares?)</LI>
<LI>Only use <B>one</B> IDE drive per IDE bus, slave disks spoil
performance</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><B>Fault survival:</B> The IDE driver usually survives a failing
IDE device. The RAID layer will mark the disk as failed, and if you
are running RAID levels 1 or above, the machine should work just fine
until you can take it down for maintenance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is <B>very</B> important, that you only use <B>one</B> IDE disk
per IDE bus. Not only would two disks ruin the performance, but the
failure of a disk often guarantees the failure of the bus, and
therefore the failure of all disks on that bus.  In a fault-tolerant
RAID setup (RAID levels 1,4,5), the failure of one disk can be
handled, but the failure of two disks (the two disks on the bus that
fails due to the failure of the one disk) will render the array
unusable. Also, when the master drive on a bus fails, the slave or the
IDE controller may get awfully confused. One bus, one drive, that's
the rule.
<P>There are cheap PCI IDE controllers out there. You often get two or
four busses for around $80. Considering the much lower price of IDE
disks versus SCSI disks, I'd say an IDE disk array could be a really
nice solution if one can live with the relatively low (around 8
probably) disks one can attach to a typical system (unless of course,
you have a lot of PCI slots for those IDE controllers).  
<P>IDE has major cabling problems though when it comes to large
arrays. Even if you had enough PCI slots, it's unlikely that you could
fit much more than 8 disks in a system and still get it running
without data corruption (caused by too long IDE cables).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Hot Swap</A>
</H2>

<P>This has been a hot topic on the linux-kernel list for some
time. Although hot swapping of drives is supported to some extent, it
is still not something one can do easily.
<P>
<H3>Hot-swapping IDE drives</H3>

<P><B>Don't !</B> IDE doesn't handle hot swapping at all.  Sure, it may
work for you, if your IDE driver is compiled as a module (only
possible in the 2.2 series of the kernel), and you re-load it after
you've replaced the drive.  But you may just as well end up with a
fried IDE controller, and you'll be looking at a lot more down-time
than just the time it would have taken to replace the drive on a
downed system.
<P>The main problem, except for the electrical issues that can destroy
your hardware, is that the IDE bus must be re-scanned after disks are
swapped. The current IDE driver can't do that.  If the new disk is
100% identical to the old one (wrt. geometry etc.), it <EM>may</EM>
work even without re-scanning the bus, but really, you're walking the
bleeding edge here.
<P>
<H3>Hot-swapping SCSI drives</H3>

<P>Normal SCSI hardware is not hot-swappable either. It <B>may</B>
however work. If your SCSI driver supports re-scanning the bus, and
removing and appending devices, you may be able to hot-swap
devices. However, on a normal SCSI bus you probably shouldn't unplug
devices while your system is still powered up. But then again, it may
just work (and you may end up with fried hardware).
<P>The SCSI layer <B>should</B> survive if a disk dies, but not all
SCSI drivers handle this yet. If your SCSI driver dies when a disk
goes down, your system will go with it, and hot-plug isn't really
interesting then.
<P>
<H3>Hot-swapping with SCA</H3>

<P>With SCA, it should be possible to hot-plug devices. However, I don't
have the hardware to try this out, and I haven't heard from anyone
who's tried, so I can't really give any recipe on how to do this.
<P>If you want to play with this, you should know about SCSI and RAID
internals anyway. So I'm not going to write something here that I
can't verify works, instead I can give a few clues:
<UL>
<LI>Grep for <B>remove-single-device</B> in
<B>linux/drivers/scsi/scsi.c</B></LI>
<LI>Take a look at <B>raidhotremove</B> and <B>raidhotadd</B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Not all SCSI drivers support appending and removing devices. In the
2.2 series of the kernel, at least the Adaptec 2940 and Symbios
NCR53c8xx drivers seem to support this, others may and may not. I'd
appreciate if anyone has additional facts here...
