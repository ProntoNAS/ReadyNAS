Description:	Provides information about the active PMU description
		module.  The module contains the mapping of the actual
		performance counter registers onto the logical PMU exposed by
		perfmon.  There is at most one PMU description module loaded
		at any time.

		The sysfs PMU tree provides a description of the mapping for
		each register. There is one subdir per config and data register
		along an entry for the name of the PMU model.

		The entries are as follows:

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/model (read-only):

		Name of the PMU model is clear text and zero terminated.

	Then, for each logical PMU register, XX, gets a subtree with the
	following entries:

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/pm*XX/addr (read-only):

		The physical address or index of the actual underlying hardware
		register.  On Itanium, it corresponds to the index. But on X86
		processor, this is the actual MSR address.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/pm*XX/dfl_val (read-only):

		The default value of the register in hexadecimal.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/pm*XX/name (read-only):

		The name of the hardware register.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/pm*XX/rsvd_msk (read-only):

		Bitmask of reserved bits, i.e., bits which cannot be changed
		by applications. When a bit is set, it means the corresponding
		bit in the actual register is reserved.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmu_desc/pm*XX/width (read-only):

		The width in bits of the registers. This field is only
		relevant for counter registers.
