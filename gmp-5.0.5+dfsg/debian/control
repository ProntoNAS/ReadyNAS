Description: Multiprecision arithmetic library
 GNU MP is a programmer's library for arbitrary precision
 arithmetic (ie, a bignum package).  It can operate on signed
 integer, rational, and floating point numeric types.
 .
 It has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular
 interface.

Description: Multiprecision arithmetic library developers tools
 This development package provides the header files and the symbolic
 links to allow compilation and linking of programs that use the libraries
 provided in the libgmp10 package.
