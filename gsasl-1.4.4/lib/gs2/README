GS2 README -- Notes on the implementation
Copyright (C) 2006, 2007 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory holds an unfinished implementation of GS2, pending
finalization of the standard.

This module is written in portable C89.  It may be used as a
stand-alone implementation, outside of the framework that GNU SASL
provide.

The files CLIENT.C and SERVER.C contain the glue between GNU SASL and
the stand-alone implementation.  Currently it is the best (only)
example on how to use the module.

For updates to the project, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/>.
