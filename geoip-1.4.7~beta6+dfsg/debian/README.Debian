geoip for Debian
----------------

The library comes with a free country database which does not contain all
the information that can be accessible via the GeoIP API. To find other
database editions, please visit http://www.maxmind.com/ (all of them except
for the one included in the package require you to purchase a license from
MaxMind)

If you have obtained the license, you must install the geoip-bin package and
copy the /etc/GeoIP.conf.default file to /etc/GeoIP.conf and edit it entering
the licensing data.


Updating databases
------------------

If you need to update your database very frequency, then you can use the
scripts in /usr/share/doc/libgeoip1/examples/ for this job. Each of them
will update one database.

Please note, that all those databases are not {DFSG-}free and that we can not
provide support for them.

There is also a known security hole with those scripts. Maxmind does not
provide any way to verify the downloaded databases (md5sum, PGP, etc.), so
they may be spoofed.
