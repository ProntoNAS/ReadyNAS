	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>

	<para>This VFS module is part of the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> suite.</para>

	<para>The <literal>vfs_recycle</literal> intercepts file deletion
	requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository
	rather than deleting them immediately. This gives the same effect
	as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers. </para>

	<para>The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer
	views of the network file system (share) nor on any mapped
	drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle will be automatically
	created when the first file is deleted and recycle:repository is
	not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the name
	of the created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users
	can recover files from the recycle bin. If the recycle:keeptree
	option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path
	identical with that from which the file was deleted.  </para>


	<para>This module is stackable.</para>

	<variablelist>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:repository = PATH</term>

		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:directory_mode = MODE</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle repository

		0700 is used. </para>
		</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:subdir_mode = MODE</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>Set MODE to the octal mode with which
		sub directories of the recycle repository should be created.
		</para>
		<para>If this option is not set, subdirectories
		will be created with the mode from recycle:directory_mode.

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:versions = BOOL</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>If this option is True, two files with the same

		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:touch = BOOL</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>Specifies whether a file's access date should be

		</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:exclude_dir = LIST</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>List of directories whose files should not be put

		<varlistentry>
		<term>recycle:noversions = LIST</term>
		<listitem>
		<para>Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as *
