  * compile shared libavcodec explicitly with $(PIC), since gcc-4.3
    mips/mipsel needs an explicit PIC flag for shared library

    Until gcc-4.2 Linux/MIPS always used PIC code, even for executables.
    This changed with gcc-4.3, and with it the compiler default changed
    to non-PIC. As a result, -fPIC now needs to be explicitly supplied
    for shared library builds.

  * cleanup 010_proper_rpath.diff: remove spurious linker search paths.
  * debian/strip.sh: no need to remove the glue code for x264 and xvid.
    However, since that code is not built in debian anyway, the orig.tar.gz
    was not rebuilt with this change.
  * provide mmx-enabled shared objects on amd64. AFAIK all amd64 machines

    please file bugs to request them.
  * rename the source package (again), this time on upstream's request.
    The former name was considered insulting by upstream, because it
    somewhat indicated the original source was somehow 'non-free', which is
    not the case. The new name now represents that we modified the package
    so that it becomes acceptable for debian.

    + Added doxygen to Build-Depends.
    + Introduced new package 'ffmpeg-doc' that contains html doxygen
      documentation of the ffmpeg API (Closes: #438369).
    + Changed Build-Depends from libdc1394-13-dev to libdc1394-22-dev,

      to libavcodec-dev (Closes: #483548).

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]

  * remove patches from the debian package as disussed with upstream:
    - 005_runtime_cpudetect.diff: it is supposed to fix runtime cpu detection
      on i386. The code (and the define) has undergone large refactoring wrt.
      the define RUNTIME_CPUDETECT. It is very likely to have undisired
      side-effects with this version of ffmpeg. It therefore seem more safe
      to me to actually remove this patch for now, and reinvestigate the
      problems that occur, if they do.  (Related to: #482717)
    - 005_m68k_workaround.diff: works around bugs in gcc for m68k.
    - 006_mips_pthreads.diff: was an workaround for (now fixed) #428741.
    - 020_fix_sws_scale_crash: patch has been rejected upstream:
      http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2008-May/047846.html
    - 054_h264_mmx_chroma_mc_crash.diff. According to upstream, this has
      been fixed in a different way and is not reproducible. Verified that
      the file referenced in bug #404176 does not crash anymore even
      without this patch.
  * new patch: 015_reenable-img_convert.diff.  Unlike previous version of this
    patch, this uses a more lightweight approach. With building imgresample, a
    few symbol clashes occur with libswscale. We therefore strip off symbols
    that are already provided by libswscale. (Closes: #483960).
  * remove 011_link_plugins.diff. It is completely unnecessary now.
  * refactor quilt usage: use /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make.
  * support building in paralell. make snippet taken from the qemu package.
  * cleanups in debian/rules.
  * Move ffmpeg-config back to libavutil. This way we can avoid a circular
    dependency between libavutil-dev and libavcodec-dev. (Closes: #484132).
    libavcodec uses libavutil internally, so this dependency cannot be avoided.
  * disable altivec, at least for now. (Closes: #482717)
  * always compile with --disable-strip. We strip the binaries afterwards using
    dh_strip anyways.
  * Remove depdency substitutions ${shlibs:Depends} and ${misc:Depends} from the
    -dev packages.

    + In this context, cleaned up build rule: Run '$(MAKE)' and '$(MAKE) clean'
