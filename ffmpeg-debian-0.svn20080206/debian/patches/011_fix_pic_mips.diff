compile shared libavcodec explicitly with $(PIC), since gcc-4.3
mips/mipsel needs an explicit PIC flag for shared library code.

Until gcc-4.2 Linux/MIPS always used PIC code, even for executables.
This changed with gcc-4.3, and with it the compiler default changed
to non-PIC. As a result, -fPIC now needs to be explicitly supplied
for shared library builds. The shared library code model remains
the same as with gcc-4.2.
