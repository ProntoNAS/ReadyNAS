.Dt SASLAUTHD 8
.Os "CMU-SASL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm saslauthd
.Nd message store authentication server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl a
.Ar authmech
.Op Fl \&Tv
.Op Fl H Ar hostname
.Op Fl m Ar mux_path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon process that handles plaintext authentication requests
on behalf of the SASL library.
.Pp
The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code requiring superuser
privileges into a single process, and it can be used to provide
.Em proxy
authentication services to clients that do not understand
SASL based authentication.
.Pp
.Nm
should be
started from the system boot scripts when going to
multi-user mode. When running against a protected authentication
database (e.g. the
.Li shadow
mechanism),
it must be run as the superuser.
.Ss Options
Options named by lower\-case letters configure the server itself.
Upper\-case options control the behavior of specific authentication
mechanisms; their applicability to a particular authentication
mechanism is described in the
.Sx AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS
section.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar authmech
Use
.Ar authmech
as the authentication mechanism. (See the
.Sx AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS
section below.) This parameter is mandatory.
.It Fl H Ar hostname
The remote host to be contacted by the
.Li rimap
authentication mechanism.
.It Fl m Ar path
Use
.Ar path
as the pathname to the named socket to listen on for
connection requests. This must be an absolute pathname.
.It Fl T
Honour time-of-day login restrictions.
.It Fl v
Print the version number and available authentication
mechanisms on standard error, then exit.
.El
.Ss Logging
.Nm
logs it's activities via
.Nm syslogd
using the
.Dv LOG_AUTH
facility.
.Sh AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS
.Nm
supports one or more
.Qq authentication mechanisms ,
dependent upon the facilities provided by the underlying operating system.
The mechanism is selected by the
.Fl a
flag from the following list of choices:
.Bl -tag -width "kerberos4"
.It Li sasldb
.Em (All platforms)
.Pp
Authenticate against the
SASL
authentication database.
.It Li dce
.Em (AIX)
.Pp
Authenticate using the DCE authentication environment.
.It Li getpwent
.Em (All platforms)
.Pp
Authenticate using the
.Fn getpwent
library function. Typically this authenticates against the
local password file. See your systems
.Xr getpwent 3
man page for details.
.It Li kerberos4
.Em (All platforms)
.Pp
Authenticate against the local Kerberos 4 realm. (See the
.Sx NOTES
section for caveats about this driver.)
.It Li rimap
.Em (All platforms)
.Pp
Forward authentication requests to a remote IMAP server. This driver
connects to a remote IMAP server, specified using the -H flag,
and attempts to login (via an IMAP
.Ql LOGIN
command) using the credentials 
supplied to the local
server. If the remote authentication succeeds the local connection
is also considered to be authenticated. The remote connection is closed
as soon as the tagged response from the
.Ql LOGIN
command is received from the remote
server.
.Pp
The
.Ar hostname
parameter to the
.Fl H
flag describes the remote server to forward
authentication requests to.
.Ar hostname
can be a hostname (imap.example.com) or a dotted\-quad IP address
(192.168.0.1). The latter is useful if the remote server is
multi\-homed and has network interfaces that are unreachable from
the local IMAP server. The remote host is contacted on the
.Ql imap
service port. A non\-default port can be specified by appending
a slash and the port name or number
to the
.Ar hostname
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fl H
flag and argument are mandatory when using the
.Li rimap
mechanism.
.It Li shadow
.Em (AIX, Irix, Linux, Solaris)
.Pp
Authenticate against the local
.Qq shadow password file .
The exact mechanism is system dependent.
.Nm
currently understands the
.Fn getspnam
and
.Fn getuserpw
library routines. Some systems
honour the
.Fl T
flag.
.It Li sia
.Em (Digital UNIX)
.Pp
Authenticate using the Digital
.Ux
Security Integration Architecture
(a.k.a.
.Qq enhanced security ) .
.El
.Sh NOTES
The
.Li kerberos4
authentication driver consumes considerable resources. To perform an
authentication it must obtain a ticket granting ticket
from the TGT server
.Sy on every authentication request.
The Kerberos library routines that obtain the TGT also create a
local ticket file, on the reasonable assumption that you will want
to save the TGT for use by other Kerberos applications. These ticket
files are unusable by
.Nm No ,
however there is no way not to create them. The overhead of creating
and removing
these ticket files can cause serious performance degradation on busy
servers. (Kerberos
was never intended to be used in this manner, anyway.)
