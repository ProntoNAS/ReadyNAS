* Version 0.9 (released 2013-07-23) [alpha]

Reported by Didier Raboud <odyx@debian.org> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/643427>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.7 (released 2011-08-11) [alpha]

** libidn2: Fix missing strchrnul and strverscmp uses.
Reported by Ray Satiro <raysatiro@yahoo.com>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.6 (released 2011-05-25) [alpha]

** tests: Use -no-install instead of -static to fix --disable-static.
Reported by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.5 (released 2011-05-18) [alpha]

** Fix NFC check to compare entire strings.
Some non-NFC strings were permitted when they should have been
rejected.  Reported by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org>.

** Self tests are not run under valgrind by default anymore.
Use --enable-valgrind-tests if you want to run self tests under
valgrind.  The reason was that there were too many false positives on
some platforms with valgrind issues in system libraries.  Self tests
are still run under valgrind by default when building from version
controlled sources.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.4 (released 2011-05-06) [alpha]

** libidn2: Fix domain name maximum size issue.
Domain names in string representation can be 254 characters long if
they end with a period, or 253 characters long if they don't end with
a period.  The code got this wrong and used 255 characters all the
time.  The documentation for the IDN2_DOMAIN_MAX_LENGTH constant is
improved.  We now pass two more of the IdnaTest.txt test vectors.
Reported by "Abdulrahman I. ALGhadir" <aghadir@citc.gov.sa> and
explanation from Markus Scherer <mscherer@google.com>.

** tests: Added several new Arabic test vectors.
From "Abdulrahman I. ALGhadir" <aghadir@citc.gov.sa>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.3 (released 2011-04-20) [alpha]

** doc: Added Texinfo manual.

** doc: Added man pages for all API functions.

** examples: Added examples/lookup and examples/register as demo.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.2 (released 2011-03-30) [alpha]

** Added command line tool "idn2".

** Added more test vectors from Unicode.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.1 (released 2011-03-29) [alpha]

** IDNA2008 Lookup+Register functions are now operational.
The implementation is still subject to changes, and thus no API/ABI
stability guarantees are made.  We are now inviting comments both on
the API (as before) but also on the actual behaviour.  Any unexpected
outputs are from here on considered as real bugs.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.0 (released 2011-03-09) [alpha]

** Initial draft release for public review of the API.
IDNA2008-Lookup is fully implemented except for 1) the optional
round-trip conversion part, and 2) the context rules are not
implemented.  IDNA2008-Register is not yet implemented.  The
implementation is known to be sub-optimal and ugly, please review the
interface and ignore the code!  Several changes are planned in the
internal implementation.
