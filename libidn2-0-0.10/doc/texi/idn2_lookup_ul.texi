@deftypefun {int} {idn2_lookup_ul} (const char * @var{src}, char ** @var{lookupname}, int @var{flags})
@var{src}: input zero-terminated locale encoded string.

@var{lookupname}: newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.

@var{flags}: optional @code{idn2_flags} to modify behaviour.

Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name @code{src}, as
described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input is assumed
to be encoded in the locale's default coding system, and will be
transcoded to UTF-8 and NFC normalized by this function.

Pass @code{IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP} in @code{flags} to convert any input A-labels
to U-labels and perform additional testing.

@strong{Returns:} On successful conversion @code{IDN2_OK} is returned, if
conversion from locale to UTF-8 fails then @code{IDN2_ICONV_FAIL} is
returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too
long @code{IDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN} or @code{IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL} is returned, or
another error code is returned.
