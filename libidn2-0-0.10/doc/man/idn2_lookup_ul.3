.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name \fIsrc\fP, as
described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input is assumed
to be encoded in the locale's default coding system, and will be
transcoded to UTF\-8 and NFC normalized by this function.

Pass \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP in \fIflags\fP to convert any input A\-labels
to U\-labels and perform additional testing.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, if
conversion from locale to UTF\-8 fails then \fBIDN2_ICONV_FAIL\fP is
returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too
long \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN\fP or \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, or
another error code is returned.
