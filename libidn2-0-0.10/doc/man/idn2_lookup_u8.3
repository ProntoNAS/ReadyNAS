.SH NAME
idn2_lookup_u8 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_lookup_u8(const uint8_t * " src ", uint8_t ** " lookupname ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint8_t * src" 12
input zero\-terminated UTF\-8 string in Unicode NFC normalized form.
.IP "uint8_t ** lookupname" 12
newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name \fIsrc\fP, as
described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input string
must be encoded in UTF\-8 and be in Unicode NFC form.

Pass \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP in \fIflags\fP to convert input to NFC form before
further processing.  Pass \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP in \fIflags\fP to
convert any input A\-labels to U\-labels and perform additional
testing.  Multiple flags may be specified by binary or:ing them
together, for example \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP | \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, if the
output domain or any label would have been too long
\fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN\fP or \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, or
another error code is returned.
