NAME
----
btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from stdin/file.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs receive* [-ve] [-f <infile>] [--max-errors <N>] <mount>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Receives one or more subvolumes that were previously
sent with *btrfs send*. The received subvolumes are stored
into <mount>.

*btrfs receive* will fail with the following case:

1. a receiving subvolume already exists.

2. a previously received subvolume was changed after it was received.

3. default subvolume is changed or you don't mount btrfs filesystem with
fs tree.

After receiving a subvolume, it is immediately set to read only.

`Options`

-v::
Enable verbose debug output. Each occurrence of this option increases the
verbose level more.
-f <infile>::
By default, btrfs receive uses stdin to receive the subvolumes.
Use this option to specify a file to use instead.
-e::
Terminate after receiving an <end cmd> in the data stream.
Without this option, the receiver terminates only if an error is recognized
or on EOF.
--max-errors <N>::
Terminate as soon as N errors happened while processing commands from the send
stream. Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*btrfs receive* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------
*btrfs* is part of btrfs-progs.
