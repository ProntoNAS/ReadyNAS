an inode or a device.
+

specify what type of object you meant. This is only needed when a
property could be set for more then one object type.
+
Possible types are 's[ubvol]', 'f[ilesystem]', 'i[node]' and 'd[evice]'.
+
The <object> can be path of btrfs device, btrfs mount point, or any
directories/files inside btrfs.
