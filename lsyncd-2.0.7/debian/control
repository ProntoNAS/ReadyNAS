Description: daemon to synchronize local directories using rsync
 Lsyncd (Live syncing mirror daemon) uses rsync to synchronize local
 directories with a remote machine running rsyncd. Lsyncd watches
 multiple directories trees through inotify. The first step after
 adding the watches is to rsync all directories with the remote host,
 and then sync single file by collecting the inotify events. So lsyncd
 is a light-weight live mirror solution that should be easy to install
 and use while blending
 well with your system.
