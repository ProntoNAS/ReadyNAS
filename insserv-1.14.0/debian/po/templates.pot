"If you choose to enable the dependency-based boot sequence the scripts in /"
"etc/rc*.d/ will be reordered using dependency information provided by LSB "
"comment headers (or defaults where these are not present). All S* symlinks "
"in rc0.d/ and rc6.d/ will be turned into K* symlinks, to make sure the way "
"they are used (with the argument 'stop') matches their names. The change "
"will only be done after it is verified that it is safe to convert. Disabling "
"it when enabled will try to revert the change."
