Description: Library for parsing configuration files
 libConfuse is a configuration file parser library written in C. It
 supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, 
 booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such as
 single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, 
 functions and nested include statements).
 .
 It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability to a
 program using a simple API.
