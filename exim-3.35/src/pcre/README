PCRE for use in Exim
--------------------

This directory contains a subset of the files from the PCRE distribution, 
enough to supply regular expression support for Exim, plus the pcretest test 
program. Do not start from here if you want to install PCRE as a free-standing 
library for use by other programs. Get the full PCRE distribution, which can be
obtained from

ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-x.x.tar.gz

where x.x is the version number. This contains support for a POSIX interface to
PCRE, a "grep" program that uses PCRE, and the means to build PCRE as a shared
library. It is configured by autoconf, and has "make install" support in the 
conventional way.
