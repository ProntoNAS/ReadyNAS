 * This code implements Dan Bernstein's Constant DataBase (cdb) spec.
 * Information, the spec and sample code for cdb can be obtained from
 *      http://www.pobox.com/~djb/cdb.html
 *
 * This implementation borrows some code from Dan Bernstein's
 * implementation (which has no license restrictions applied to it).
 * This (read-only) implementation is completely contained within
 * cdb.[ch] it does *not* link against an external cdb library.
 *
 *
 * There are 2 varients included within this code.  One uses MMAP and
 * should give better performance especially for multiple lookups on a
 * modern machine.  The other is the default implementation which is
 * used in the case where the MMAP fails or if MMAP was not compiled
 * in.  this implementation is the same as the original reference cdb
 * implementation.
