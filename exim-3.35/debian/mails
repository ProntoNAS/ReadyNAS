There is nothing in the NFS spec that requires the client to update its
cached link count[*]. So I would assume the author's claim means that this
locking technique `works better over NFS on the systems I tested it on.'

Nevertheless, I guess I'll have to support this in the upcoming NFS
code... For the time being, I suggest exim users apply the following
patch to fs/nfs/dir.c, function nfs_link:

-------- fake patch -----
	nfs_lookup_cache_remove(dir, oldinode, NULL);
+	NFS_CACHEINV(oldinode);
	iput(oldinode);
-------------------------

IMHO, mounting your mail spool with the noac mount option is not a
very good idea.

[*] The NFS spec is deliberately vague about how and to which extent
the client caches information. Vague being an overstatement here.
For those interested, the bare-bones protocol spec is available as
RFC 1094. There's also a (fairly expensive) specification available
from X/Open that also discusses some implementation issues as well as
the side effects on various system calls and utility programs. Some
information about current implementation practice can also be found in
the NFSv3 spec (available as RFC, and as postscript file all over the
net--archie for nfsv3.ps).

"standard" rmail uucp is easy..

use something like this..

# a transport
uucp_pipe:
  driver = pipe;
  #ignore_status,
  user = uucp,
  directory = "/tmp",
  restrict_to_path,
  path = "/usr/bin:/bin",
  command = "uux - -a$sender_address -r $host\!rmail ($local_part@$domain)",
  return_output

# a router example entry
uucpdomainlist:
  driver = domainlist,
  transport = uucp_pipe;
  search_type = dbm,
  route_file = "/usr/exim/table/uucpdom";


# the uucpdom file is like "wibble.com: wibblesys"


Batched SMTP over uucp is also possible, I have not tried it yet.

Just FYI:  One of the important configuration options (compile-time,
unfortunately) in the ancient smail-2.x was a limit to the total length
of the argument list passed to uux(1).  In some older UUCP's this limit
was as low as 127 characters.  It might be of some value to see if there
is any limit in the Taylor-UUCP (GNU) implementation of uux or uuxqt
(other than the maximum command-line limits which unfortunately may be
different in the remote machine, though in theory uuxqt could cause
multiple invocations of rmail to cope, though this breaks the uux
interface just a bit).

BTW, the 1.60 mechanisms seem generally applicable to many uses!

User-Agent: Mutt/1.1.9i

package: exim
severity: wishlist

I'm running a single machine that's only temporarily connected to the Internet.
I'm using a free email service for my emails and I tried to configure exim to
recognize just this specific email address (my@address.com) as a local email
address and all others (e.g. others@address.com) as remote emails.

After a whole day of reading exim's manual, I've finally found a solution.
I've put these lines into the Routers Configuration section in /etc/exim.conf:

local_indeed:
  driver = domainlist
  domains = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/email-local}{$value}}
  self = local
  route_list = "* 127.0.0.1 byname"

The file /etc/email-local contains key:value pairs that tell exim which
addresses should be considered local:

schoepf: domain1.org:domain2.com:...:domain3.com

Maybe you could include this as an example into the exim package so that
others who want such a behavior don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Thank you!

Thomas

[I did announce this on the exim-users list 10 days ago, but am 
resending to this list]

I have made a new version of the Exim Windows generic executable 
filter, taking it to version 0.09.

The filter, which runs as a system filter, attempts to detect messages 
with attachments that may contain executables under windows.  These 
could potentially be trojans, virus infected or other problematic 
content.  A number of windows based email worms/viruses send out 
messages which will be detected and blocked by the filter.

The method of detecting MIME attachments using regular expressions is 
very limited.  However its a low cost and so far quite effective means 
of blocking attacks from the various windows email problems.

Instructions for installation are included within the file.

The filter is available at
	ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/
	http://www.exim.org/system_filter.exim

The MD5 is
 6d17e5999c36e2a2297bfdc7a0bb771d  system_filter.exim

	Nigel.
