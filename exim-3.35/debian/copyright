This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of exim, a powerful yet easy
to configure mail transport agent.

This package was originally made by Tim Cutts <timc@chiark.greenend.org.uk>,
and is now maintained by Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>. It was put together
from the original sources which are maintained by Philip Hazel
<ph10@cus.cam.ac.uk>, and which were obtained from

	ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/email/exim/

Some modifications to the Makefiles have been made to fit with the Linux
FHS.

The program is copyright (c) 1999 University of Cambridge.

The original licence is as follows (from the file NOTICE in the upstream
distribution); the GPL should be in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL on a debian
system.

UNSOLICITED E-MAIL
-----------------

The supply or promotion of Exim for the purpose of sending bulk, unsolicited
e-mail is incompatible with the basic aims of the program, which revolve around
the free provision of a service that enhances the quality of personal
communications. The author of Exim regards indiscriminate mass-mailing as an
antisocial, irresponsible abuse of the Internet.


INCORPORATED CODE
-----------------

Three pieces of external code are included in the Exim distribution.

  Regular expressions are supported in the main Exim program and in the
  Exim monitor using Henry Spencer's freely-distributable set of func-
  tions, copyright (c) 1986 University of Toronto. Some modifications have
  been made to the source, which is distributed in the directory called
  regexp, to add a few Perl-like extensions. The extended source files have
  an "e" added at the start of their names.

  RFC 1413 callbacks are supported in the main Exim program using the
  libident library made freely available by Peter Eriksson at
  ftp.lysator.liu.se. Some modifications have been made to the source,
  which is distributed in the directory called src/libident, to support
  IPv6.

  The Exim Monitor program, which is an X-Window application, includes a
  modified version of the Athena StripChart and TextPop widgets. This code
  is copyright by DEC and MIT, and their permission notice appears below,
  in accordance with the conditions expressed therein.
