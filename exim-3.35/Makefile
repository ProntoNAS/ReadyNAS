# Top-level makefile for Exim; handles creating a build directory with
# appropriate links, and then creating and running the main makefile in that
# directory.

# IRIX make uses the shell that is in the SHELL variable, which often defaults
# to csh, so put this in to make it use the Bourne shell. In systems where
# /bin/sh is not a Bourne-compatible shell, this line will have to be edited,
# or "make" must be called with a different SHELL= setting.

SHELL=/bin/sh

# If a build name has not been specified by running this make file via a
# command of the form "make build=xxxx", then determine the name of the
# operating system and the machine architecture and use that. This does not
# provide an override for the OS type and architecture type; they still have
# to be used for the OS-specific files. To override them, you can set the
# shell variables OSTYPE and ARCHTYPE when running make.

buildname=$${build:-`$(SHELL) scripts/os-type`-`$(SHELL) scripts/arch-type`}

# The default target checks for the existence of Local/Makefile, that the main
# makefile is built and up-to-date, and then it runs it.
