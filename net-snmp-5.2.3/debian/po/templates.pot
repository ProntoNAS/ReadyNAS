"Debian now uses the NET SNMP agent/daemon.  Since the new agent uses an "
"entirely new configuration file format, any configuration you may have "
"previously had can not be automatically updated and must be replaced.  "
"Consequently, a security-conscious configuration will be installed by "
"default.  Please read the snmpd.conf(5) manual page and then edit /etc/snmp/"
"snmpd.conf accordingly to change the configuration to suit your needs."
