net-snmp (5.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 5.2.2, the default configuration disables SMUX support
  and binds the SNMP port to 127.0.0.1.
  
  Please configure /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny
  first to set up who can access the SNMP daemon, then edit
  /etc/default/snmpd and remove 127.0.0.1 from SNMPDOPTS.

  To enable SMUX again, remove "-I -smux" from SNMPDOPTS and eventually
  bind it to localhost by adding "smuxsocket 127.0.0.1" to
  /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.
