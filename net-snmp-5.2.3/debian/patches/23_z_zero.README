Patch from Peder Chr. Norgaard <Peder.Chr.Norgaard@ericsson.com>:

The option for setting engineBoot and engineTime does not accept the
perfectly valid value 0 (zero).  OK, I admit that the values are
somewhat unusual, but according to RFC 3414 they are legal.  And I
needed them to test a border condition in an SNMP agent.

The reason for the values not being accepted seems to simply be unprecise
testing of the return value for "strtoul".  I include a patch that does a
somewhat better job.
