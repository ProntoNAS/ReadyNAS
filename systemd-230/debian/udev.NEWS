systemd (220-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The mechanism for providing stable network interface names changed.
    Previously they were kept in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
    which mapped device MAC addresses to the (arbitrary) name they got when
    they first appeared (i. e. mostly at the time of installation). As this
    had several problems and is not supported any more, this is deprecated in
    favor of the "net.ifnames" mechanism. With this most of your network
    interfaces will get location-based names. If you have ifupdown, firewall,
    or other configuration that relies on the old names, you need to update
    these by Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and then remove
    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Please see
    /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian.gz for details about this.
