lvm-common (1.5.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /dev/lvm before checking the iopversion as LVM1
    needs userspace to create the device (!) before use.
    It's difficult to express in words how badly LVM1 behaves when

    using the lvm1 kernel driver.  This should stop cases where there are

 -- Robert van der Meulen <rvdm@debian.org>  Thu,  3 May 2001 00:29:44 +0200

lvm-common (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

lvm-common (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New package containing many parts of the old LVM package.
    Also has the lvmiopversion binary, and the script mechanism
    for maintaining symlinks to this binary.
  * This package depends on lvm-binaries, which is a virtual package
    in turn provided by the new invidual lvm6, lvm10, etc. packages
    (one for each protocol revision). The old "lvm" package is now a
    dummy package which depends on lvm5, which provides the same
    protocol revision as the old 0.8i-3 package (the last "real"
    lvm package to be uploaded to Debian).
  * All the packages are built from different source packages in the
    new scheme.

    couple of revisions back (Closes: #62871).
