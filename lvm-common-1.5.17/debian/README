Notes about the Debian packaging of LVM
=======================================

The /etc/init.d/lvm script checks for the existence of /proc/lvm before it
will work. If you do not wish to compile /proc support for LVM into your
kernel, you should edit the /etc/init.d/lvm script so that it doesn't
make this check.

Also note that if you compile LVM as a module, you will have to add it to
/etc/modules in order for the lvm init.d script to run properly.

This check is made to ensure that LVM will never be started on a kernel
that doesn't support it.

The script now also checks for the existence of /dev/.devfsd, and will
run vgscan if this is found to create the devices required.


The permissions on the LV devices files is set to root.disk 0660 if you
are either not running devfs OR you are running devfs and your VGs are called
"vg" followed by some numbers. If you want the permissions to be set as above
and your VGs have some other name then you may need to edit the regexp in
/etc/devfsd/conf.d/50lvm.


Selection of LVM version
------------------------

lvm-common dynamically selects the version of the LVM tools to suit the
kernel you are running. So, if you are running, for example, a 2.4 kernel
with only LVM1 support then LVM1 tools will be run. If you are running a
2.6 kernel (which only has device-mapper) then the LVM2 tools will be run.

However, because it is possible to compile a 2.4 kernel with both LVM1 and 
device-mapper(for LVM2) support in it lvm-common has to try a little harder.
Normally it will prefer to use LVM2 over LVM1 (if both packages are installed);
however, if it detects that you already have active LVM1 volumes then it will
use LVM1 instead.

For more details see the source package to lvm-common.
