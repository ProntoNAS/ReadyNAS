provides a coherent mechanism for selecting and storing a preferred sensible-editor on a per-user basis.  It lists the available editors on a system and interactively prompts the user to select one.  The results are stored as SELECTED_EDITOR in ~/.selected_editor, which is sourced and used by sensible-editor.  SELECTED_EDITOR is overridden by the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables.
