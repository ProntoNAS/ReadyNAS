To use ifplugd with SuSE Linux you have to change the start mode of all
interfaces mentioned in ifplugd.conf to manual instead of onboot.
Hotplug devices should specify hotplug as usual.

For example:

if /etc/ifplugd/ifplugd.conf contains

	INTERFACES='eth0'

your /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0 must contain

	STARTMODE='manual'
