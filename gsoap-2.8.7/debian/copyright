Disclaimer:
 The gSOAP public license is a modified version of the Mozilla Public License.
 Due to the modifications, the gSOAP public license is non-free. You can not
 use gsoap under this license for software that you intend to contribute to
 debian. If you use gsoap in debian you must use it under the GPL license,
 possibly using the OpenSSL linking exception. The specific modification that
 makes the license non-free is in section 3.2:
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in
 Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.
Comment:
 Code released only under the non-free gSOAP public license was removed from
 the source tarball. See the get-orig-source rule in debian/rules for details.
