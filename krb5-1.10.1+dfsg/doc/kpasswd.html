<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>kpasswd</B> [<I>principal</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <I>kpasswd</I> command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.
       <I>Kpasswd</I> prompts for the current Kerberos password,  which  is  used  to
       obtain  a  <B>changepw</B>  ticket from the KDC for the user's Kerberos realm.
       If <B>kpasswd</B> successfully  obtains  the  <B>changepw</B>  ticket,  the  user  is
       prompted twice for the new password, and the password is changed.

       If  the  principal  is  governed  by a policy that specifies the length
       and/or number of character classes required in the  new  password,  the
       new  password  must conform to the policy.  (The five character classes
       are lower case, upper case, numbers, punctuation, and all other charac‐
       ters.)

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <I>principal</I>
              change  the password for the Kerberos principal <I>principal</I>.  Oth‐
              erwise, <I>kpasswd</I> uses the principal name from an existing  ccache
              if there is one; if not, the principal is derived from the iden‐
              tity of the user invoking the <I>kpasswd</I> command.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTS</H2><PRE>
       <B>kpasswd</B> looks first for kpasswd_server = host:port in the [realms] sec‐
       tion  of  the krb5.conf file under the current realm.  If that is miss‐
       ing, <B>kpasswd</B> looks for the admin_server entry, but substitutes 464  for
       the port.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <B>kpasswd</B>  may  not  work  with  multi-homed hosts running on the Solaris
       platform.
