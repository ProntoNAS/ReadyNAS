Date Format
===============

.. include:: ../admin_commands/kadmin_local.rst
   :start-after:  _date_format:
   :end-before: _date_format_end:

.. note:: If the date specification contains spaces, you must enclose it in double quotes. 
          Note also that you cannot use a number without a unit. 
          (I.e., ""60 seconds"" is correct, but "60" is incorrect.) All keywords are case-insensitive.
