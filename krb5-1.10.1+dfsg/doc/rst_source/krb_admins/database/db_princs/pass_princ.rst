Changing passwords
============================

To change a principal's password use the *kadmin* **change_password** command.
     
.. include:: ../../admin_commands/kadmin_local.rst
   :start-after:  _change_password:
   :end-before: _change_password_end:

.. note::  *change_password* will not let you change the password to one that is in the principal's password history.
