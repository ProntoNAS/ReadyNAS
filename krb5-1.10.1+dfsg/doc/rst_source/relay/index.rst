Kerberos Documentation Relay
=======================================


Philosophy.
-----------

#. The documentation must be useful;

#. The documentation must be correct;

#. The documentation must be detailed, but optimized. No verbose mode;

#. The documentation should be built incrementally;

#. The documentation should be easy to maintain;

#. The documentation should be examined to identify the approaches that do not work;



Process.
------------

#. The Work-To-Do list is created and updated based on the input from the community.
#. Administrator supports the Work-To-Do list.
#. Writer picks up the item from this list (such as specific API) and writes the documentation
#. Committee reviews the documentation and recommends it to be accepted as-is or to be revised
#. If the documentation needs revision, it is sent to the initial writer or someone else for completion 
#. Once Committee approves the document, it is proofread by the designated engineer
#. Documented is posted on the web
