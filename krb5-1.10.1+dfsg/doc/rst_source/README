HTML
====

To build the documentation as HTML pages run:

sphinx-build source_dir  destination_dir

where 
source_dir is the source directory which includes configuration file conf.py and all source files;
destination_dir is the directory for the built documentation.

Once completed, the newly generated HTML documentation can be viewed from the browser by pointing to destination_dir/index.html


MAN PAGES
=========

Similarly, to build the documentation as man pages run:

sphinx-build -b man source_dir  destination_dir

The list of manual pages to be built should be constructed under man_pages section on conf.py
