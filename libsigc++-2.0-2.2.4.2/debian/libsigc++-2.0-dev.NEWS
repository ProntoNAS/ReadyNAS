libsigc++-2.0 (2.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This version of libsigc++ removes the deprecated "SigC" namespace.
  If you have software that is still using this namespace, it will fail
  to compile.
  
  Luckily, many of the names in this namespace are typedefs for names
  in the "sigc" namespace.  For instance, if your code uses SigC::Connection,
  it can be replaced by sigc::connection.  See the version 2.0 documentation
  for information on the replacement for each member of SigC:
