liblocale-gettext-perl (1.05-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put ${perl:Depends} back into Pre-Depends. The revert in 1.05-2 was
    wrong. The pre-dependency is needed to make sure that the right perl
    version is unpacked before liblocale-gettext-perl so that any
    script/module using Locale::Gettext (still) work once this module
    has been unpacked. This is particulary important for transitions like
    perl-5.8 -> perl-5.10 (see #479220 for example).
  * New patch debian/patches/compatibility-with-POSIX-module.diff so that
    Locale::Gettext re-exports the LC_* constants coming from POSIX instead
    of those coming from its own XS implementation. Closes: #479803

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Change priority to required to match overrides.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * debian/watch: use dist-based URL.
  * debian/rules:
    + put -Wall in CFLAGS
    + use "$@" when touching stamps
    + use $(CURDIR) instead of `pwd`
    + make build-stamp target depend on $(QUILT_STAMPFN) instead of 'patch'
    + drop unneeded dh_installdirs and debian/dirs
    + split DESTDIR and PREFIX when calling $(MAKE) install
    + correct the logic around removing empty usr/share/perl5 so that it does
      not fail when the directory does not exist
    + drop commented-out and unneeded debhelper calls

  [ Niko Tyni ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

liblocale-gettext-perl (1.05-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Move myself to Uploaders and put the team as Maintainer.
  * Switch to debhelper's 6th compatibility mode. Ajust Build-Depends
    accordingly. Used debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT.
  * Remove versioned build-dependency on perl. oldstable already has a version
    new enough.

  * Switched to quilt instead of old home-made dpatch based system.
    Added quilt to Build-Depends.
  * Refreshed patch.
  * Updated README.Debian.
  * Remove empty /usr/share/perl5.
  * Merge Pre-Depends into Depends since the reason of the use of Pre-Depends
    was wrong headed. Furthermor the bug it was working around is now fixed.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * debian/control: Added: Vcs-Svn field (source stanza); Vcs-Browser
    field (source stanza); Homepage field (source stanza). Removed: XS-
    Vcs-Svn fields.
