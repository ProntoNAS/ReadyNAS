cracklib2 (2.7-8.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload. Urgency medium as this is keeping other packages
    out of testing.
  * debian/dpkg.common/rules: Move calls to dpkg-shlibdeps and
    dpkg-gencontrol from the build target to binary, as dpkg-shlibdeps
    doesn't like being called as non-root (closes: #97855).
  * Call ldconfig without arguments, for the Hurd (closes: #108822).
  * Fix typo in crack_teststr(8)'s NAME section (closes: #99512).
  * Exit 0 and don't complain in the syslog if cracklib-runtime is removed
    but not purged (closes: #95291).
  * logger is no longer used as a result of the above (closes: #62393).

cracklib2 (2.7-8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/dpkg.common/modifysrc: Support build environments where the
    .orig.tar.gz is not present in the parent directory (thanks, Mikko
    Markus Torni; closes: #87355).
  * debhelper namespacing was fixed in previous NMU, but fixed it more
    neatly while I'm here (closes: #75376).
  * Move to FHS locations for documentation (thanks, Jonathon M. Abbott;
    closes: #91135, #91136, #91407, #91414, #91429).
  * Don't link with -nodefaultlibs, as it has bad effects on some platforms
    (closes: #72244).
  * Add Section: and Priority: to the .deb's control file (lintian).
  * Bump Standards-Version: to 3.1.1 and add build-dependency on debhelper
    (>= 2.0.89) (closes: #70239).
  * Fixed debian/dpkg.common/{check,substfiles}: both of them grepped the
    output of dpkg-parsechangelog for "Version: " instead of "^Version: ",
    which broke with the above changelog entry.
