libntlm (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version. Closes: #554722
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to binaries' Depends since we use debhelper.
    This makes lintian happier.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4. We still use GNU style variables
    for architecture specification, but that's because we use them with
    upstream build system, as allowed by policy.
  * Change Maintainer to XMPP team and add Simon Josefsson as uploader.
