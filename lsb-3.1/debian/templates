_Description: Should shadow passwords be enabled?
 The Linux Standard Base requires that certain features of adduser(8) be
 available to conforming applications (such as password aging). Debian only
 provides these features when shadow passwords are enabled; however, your
 system currently has shadow passwords disabled.
 .
 Most LSB applications will work fine with either setting, but 100%
 conformance requires shadow passwords to be enabled.
 .
 Generally speaking, it is considered good practice to enable shadow
 passwords.  However, there are some situations in which shadow passwords
 may not work properly (most notably, if non-root users need to
 authenticate passwords against /etc/passwd).
 .
 If you answer in the affirmative, the command 'shadowconfig on' will be
 run to enable shadow passwords.
