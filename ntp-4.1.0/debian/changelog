ntp (1:4.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add debconf support, borrowing lightly from the Progeny implementation,
    and examples in other Debian packages.  The list of servers to be used by 
    ntpd and ntpdate are now shared.  A side effect of debconf support is use 
    of /etc/default/ntp-servers, which means /etc/init.d/ntpdate no longer 
    needs to be modified by hand.  The admin may optionally do it all manually.

  * add xntp3 meta-package to facilitate slink->potato upgrades since package
    names changed, closes: #53532
  * the cron.weekly/ntp script deletes files in /var/log/ntpstats that are
    older than a week.  this means that at most 2 weeks of daily stats files
    have been present at any given time.  since deleting these old stats file
    does not require daemon cycling, I'm moving this to a cron.daily so only
    a week of files will be present.  Closes: #53598
  * while I'm messing with log rotation, modify cron.weekly to invert the
    nesting of the conditions.  This way, if there is no logfile definition
    in /etc/ntp.conf, and ntpd is therefore using syslog(), we won't kill and
    restart the daemon to rotate the non-existent log file.  
  * update configure-ntp to comment-out the logfile definition so that ntpd
    will use syslog, and not require cycling weekly for log file rotation.  
    This will cause ntpd logging to end up in daemon.log, since we do not have
    a LOG_NTP facility at this time, forcing ntpd to use LOG_DAEMON.  Wishlist
    bug filed against libc6-dev asking for a LOG_NTP.  Leave the cron.weekly
    alone, and don't do anything automatic to remove the logfile entry from
    /etc/ntp.conf... but add a note to README.Debian explaining the choices.
