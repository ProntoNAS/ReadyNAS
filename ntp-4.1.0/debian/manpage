ntp \- NTP daemon and clients
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B NTP
server and clients do not have useful man pages.  Please do not report this 
as a bug.

If you want to learn more about these commands, you should install the 
optional package "ntp-doc" which will install the HTML sources to the 
documentation for these commands, which will then be readable with your
favorite WWW browser.
