Description: XML parsing C library - development kit (64bit)
 This package contains the header file and development libraries of
 expat, the C library for parsing XML.  Expat is a stream oriented XML
 parser.  This means that you register handlers with the parser prior
 to starting the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser
 discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.  A
 start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
 register handlers.
 .
 This package includes the development support files for building 64 bit
 applications.

Description: XML parsing C library - runtime library (64bit)
 This package contains the runtime, shared library of expat, the C
 library for parsing XML. Expat is a stream-oriented parser in
 which an application registers handlers for things the parser
 might find in the XML document (like start tags).
 .
 This package includes the 64 bit version of the shared library.

Description: XML parsing C library - example application
 This package contains xmlwf, an example application of expat, the C
 library for parsing XML.  The arguments to xmlwf are one or more
 files which are each to be checked for XML well-formedness.
