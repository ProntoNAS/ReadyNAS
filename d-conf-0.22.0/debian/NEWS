d-conf (0.14.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This version of dconf has some internal changes in how applications
  communicate with the dconf service. Applications that use the old
  dconf library (libdconf0) can still communicate with the new dconf
  service, but newly-launched applications using the new dconf library
  (libdconf1) will not be able to use the old dconf service, and will
  fail to load their configuration.

  After upgrading, your old version of the dconf service will still be
  running. Restarting your X session is recommended (log out, and log
  back in); this will start a new dconf service.
