Template: samba/generate_smbpasswd
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Create samba password database, /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb?
 To be compatible with the defaults in most versions of Windows, Samba must
 be configured to use encrypted passwords.  This requires user passwords to
 be stored in a file separate from /etc/passwd.  This file can be created
 automatically, but the passwords must be added manually by running
 smbpasswd and be kept up-to-date in the future.
 .
 If you do not create it, you will have to reconfigure Samba (and probably
 your client machines) to use plaintext passwords.
 .

 /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/Samba3-Developers-Guide/pwencrypt.html
 from the samba-doc package for more details.

__Choices: daemons, inetd

_Description: How do you want to run Samba?

 a daemon is the recommended approach.
