Title: SAMBA Developers Guide
Author: Jelmer R. Vernooij
Abstract: This book is a collection of documents that might be useful
 for people developing samba or those interested in doing so. It's
 nothing more than a collection of documents written by Samba developers
 about the internals of various parts of Samba and the SMB protocol.
 It's still (and will always be) incomplete. The most recent version of
 this document can be found at http://devel.samba.org/.
