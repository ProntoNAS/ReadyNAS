msmtp is an SMTP client.

In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server (for example at a 
free mail provider) which does the delivery. 
To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create a configuration 
file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to call msmtp instead of 
/usr/sbin/sendmail.

Features include:
- sendmail compatible interface (command line options and exit codes)
- SMTP AUTH methods PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL
  (and GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM when compiled with GNU SASL support)
- TLS encrypted connections with the GnuTLS or OpenSSL libraries
  (including server certificate verification and the possibility to send
  a client certificate)
- LMTP support
- DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support
- RMQS (Remote Message Queue Starting) support (ETRN keyword)
- PIPELINING support for increased transmission speed
- IPv6 support
- support for multiple accounts
