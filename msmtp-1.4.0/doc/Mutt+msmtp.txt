1. Install msmtp:
   
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install


2. Configure msmtp:

   Create the file .msmtprc in your home directory.
   Put the following commands in it:
    
     host smtp.yourprovider.example
     from you@yourprovider.example
    
   This is sufficient, but you may want to use SMTP authentication (instead of
   POP-before-SMTP for example). Simply add
     
     user Joe.Example
     password Joe'sSecret

   to the same file.
   Using TLS encryption is always a good idea, so add the line

     tls


3. Tell Mutt to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail:

   Add the following line to your Mutt configuration file:

     set sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
   
   If msmtp complains about unknown options, search for sendmail specific
   options in your Mutt configuration file (those that include a
   warning in the muttrc man page similar to "you should not enable this 
   unless you are using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater.")
   Disable them. They are not needed for msmtp. 
   
   
4. If you want to know how to set up multiple accounts, DSN, advanced TLS
   options, and other more or less useful stuff, read the msmtp man page.
