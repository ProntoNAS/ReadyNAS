Version 1.4.0:
- gnulib update
- Correctly handle null characters in the input by replacing fgets() with
  stream_gets() and fputs() with fwrite()
- Do tilde expansion for the following options, in case the shell did not do
  it: --tls-trust-file, --tls-key-file, --tls-cert-file, --logfile
- Make the OpenSSL code accept self signed certificates in the default mode
  (tls_cert_check on, tls_trust_file unset). This should have been in 1.3.6, but
  I forgot one case. The GnuTLS code always did this. 
  Reported by Luis A. Florit.
- Fixed a memory leak in the tempfile() function.
- Improved SMTP command pipelining:
  1. Limited the number of pipelined SMTP commands to SMTP_PIPELINE_LIMIT
     (currently 100) to avoid exceeding the TCP windows size when sending 
     to *lots* of recipients. 
  2. Pipeline the DATA command in addition to MAIL FROM and RCPT TO.
     This saves one round trip. Hooray!
  Both changes affect smtp_send_envelope() only. This function was rewritten.
- Only send the QUIT command in the following two situations:
  - the SMTP session ended normally
  - msmtp cannot proceed with the SMTP session because the SMTP server lacks a
    feature
  On all other errors, don't bother to send QUIT, just abort the session.
- Handle To, Cc, and Bcc headers case insensitive (allow for example CC and
  BCC). Reported by Michael D Henderson. Thanks!
- Accept CRLF line ends in the mail (both header and body). Suggested by
  Michael D Henderson. Thanks!
- Accept CRLF line ends in the configuration files.
- Fixed --read-recipients long option: it wrongly required an argument.
  Reported by Michael D Henderson. Thanks!
- Fixed the dsn_return and dsn_notify commands: they now accept the argument
  "off", as documented. Patch by Maciej Blizi≈Ñski. Thanks!
- Minor documentation changes
- Changes taken from mpop:
  - Improved network input/output, including input buffering. Initiated by
    Dimitris Apostolou.
  - net_gets()/tls_gets() now return the length of the string, and
    net_puts()/tls_puts() now take a length argument. This saves some strlen()
    calls. Original patch by Dimitris Apostolou.

Version 1.3.9:
- Added support for .netrc
- Minor documentation changes
- Log user name if authentication is used (suggested by Jim Fohlin)
- An account from the system configuration file cannot be partially changed in
  the user configuration file anymore; it must be replaced completely instead.
- Added missing connection timeout documentation.
- Implemented LMTP. LMTP can be activated with the protocol command or 
  --protocol option. Adapted the setting of the default port. Removed "SMTP" 
  from some error strings that are also valid for LMTP.
- Minor fix in net.c: net_open_socket() could have wrongly reported success in
  very obscure situations.
- Allow an empty string as domain parameter; don't use NULL
- Updated AUTHORS

Version 1.3.8:
- Moved setting of default port from conf.c to msmtp.c. Setting a port in a
  "defaults" section should now work correctly.
- For all commands and options that accept the argument "on": also accept
  no argument, an treat that the same as "on".
- Moved lib to gnulib and m4 to gnulib/m4
- Use gnulib module sysexits.h
- Replace xmalloc.[ch] with gnulib module xalloc
- Simplify crypto.[ch]: Always use gnulib md5. This avoids error checking that
  was necessary because of the libgcrypt code.
- Fixed some pedantic compiler/lint warnings
- Minor output format changes
- Rewrote the OpenSSL specific hostname matching code:
  - It only allows one form of wildcard in the certificate name: "*." as the
    two leftmost characters. See the comment for hostname_match() in tls.c
    for the reasons for this.
  - It does not require memrchr() anymore, therefore the gnulib memrchr module
    was removed.
  - It does not break with "tcc -b" anymore.
- Close the temporary file as soon as possible in msmtp_sendmail()
- Only replace characters for which iscntrl() returns true with question marks
  in msmtp_sanitize(). Replacing every character for which isprint() is false
  is too restrictive. Now UTF-8 is passed through.
- Minor documentation improvements. The texinfo documentation now contains
  a section "Environment / Files", which was previously only in the man page.
- Added missing const qualifiers
- Fixed temporary file handling on Win32. This means that -t/--read-recipient
  now works properly on Win32.
- Fixed error handling for the temp file used by msmtp_read_recipient().
  One fix is for a potential segfault in case of temp file io errors.
- Changed the tempfile() function to create a file that is automatically
  deleted when closed, thus eliminating the need to return the file name.
  This required a mkstemp+unlink replacement for DOS/Windows (see paths.c).
- Replaced the DEFAULT_SYSLOG_FACILITY macro with the
  get_default_syslog_facility() function.
- The default values from a defaults section in a system configuration file
  are not valid in the user configuration file anymore, to prevent changes in 
  the system configuration file from breaking user setups.
- sanitize more strings before printing or logging them
- fixed compilation on systems that don't have socklen_t, for example MacOS X

Version 1.3.7:
- Better authentication error messages
- Be more strict when checking the port/--port argument
- Added the new connect_timeout command and --connect-timeout option. Suggested
  by Jim Fohlin.
- configure.ac: only try to find GNU SASL manually if pkgconfig is not found
- Added specialisation to account definitions. See documentation of the
  account command and the example files. Suggested by Jim Fohlin.
- Added a password callback function that reads a password via getpass() if
  needed. Suggested by lots of people.
- Added a user configuration file permission check: It must have no more
  permissions than 0600. Suggested by lots of people.

Version 1.3.6:
- Added new, completely rewritten documentation in texinfo format.
  Also distribute the generated html and pdf formats.
- Added a "defaults" command. Suggested by Jim Fohlin.
- Accept "AUTH=" as an alternative to "AUTH " in EHLO response. There are
  still some broken servers that use "AUTH=". Reported by Multik.
- Added authentication mechanism EXTERNAL (both built-in and via GSASL).
- Updated GnuTLS dependency to 1.2.0.
- Accept self-signed certificates in the certificate chain in the default
  settings (tls_cert_check on, tls_trust_file unset).
  This only affects the OpenSSL code; the GnuTLS code did it already.
- Improved the OpenSSL certificate name check (host name versus the
  subjectAltNames or the common name of the peer certificate). The
  improvements were partially taken from libesmtp-1.0.3r1, Copyright 2001-2004
  Brian Stafford, Released under the LGPL.
- Fixed ACC_SYSLOG constant in conf.h. (Jim Fohlin)
- Add SSL_CFLAGS and GSASL_CFLAGS to CFLAGS in configure.ac. Should fix
  compilation on various systems, including RH9. (Jim Fohlin)
- the --dsn-notify and --dsn-return options don't accept empty arguments
  anymore
- moved md5_hmac function from smtp.c to the new crypto.c file
- When neither GnuTLS nor OpenSSL is used, always use the gnulib MD5
  implementation, even if the BSD MD5 API is available. The gnulib md5.h
  header shadows the system md5.h header, and trying to solve this results in
  a mess that isn't worth it.
  This fixes compilation with --disable-ssl on a system with the BSD MD5 API.
- changed the --from option: an empty argument unsets the envelope from
  address now
- Do not ignore open errors on user configuration files specified with
  -C/--file.
- Display configuration file loading information with --pretend, too (not just
  with --debug). Fixed display of this information in case of an unknown home
  directory.
- gnulib update
- use automake 1.9.4

Version 1.3.5:
- minor man page cleanups
- forbid empty arguments for the following commands: auth, tls,
  tls_certcheck, tls_starttls, keepbcc, dsn_notify, dsn_return
- removed unnecessary and broken detection of DJGPP systems in configure.ac
- changed the following options from having an optional argument to having a
  required argument: --auth, --tls, --tls-certcheck, --tls-starttls, --keepbcc
- changed the from command: an empty argument is now accepted and unsets the
  envelope from address
- changed the domain command: an empty argument is now accepted and unsets the
  EHLO domain
- always contruct an envelope from address if none is given
- added a maildomain command and --maildomain option
- added a sylog command and --syslog option
- added a system wide configuration file: SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc. Set SYSCONFDIR
  with the --sysconfdir configure option.
- check if DSN is available as soon as possible in msmtp_sendmail()
- fixed a bug in the dsn_notify configuration file command: it stopped parsing
  of the configuration file
- allow empty configuration files
- don't require recipients when --pretend is used
- splitted main() in parts

Version 1.3.4:
- Fixed built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication. The error was introduced when
  switching to the gnulib base64 implementation. Reported by Martin Hauke.
- Use getservbyname() to get the default port for smtp or ssmtp. Use
  25/465 as fallback.
- added authentication to msmtp_rmqs()
- don't test if requested auth mech is compiled in when --serverinfo is used,
  because --serverinfo does not use auth
- the SHA1 and MD5 fingerprints of the peer's certificate were added to the
  certificate information output
- --serverinfo: always print port number
- cleanups in conf.[ch]
- fixed the setting of the default port
- fixed several memory leaks reported by valgrind
- minor changes in the man page
- killed prototype for nonexistant function from conf.h
- use AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/lib in src/Makefile.am and change 
  #include <md5.h> to #include "md5.h" in smtp.c to solve the MD5 build
  issues. Also replaced #include "../lib/base64.h" with #include "base64.h"
  and killed the #ifdef'ed inclusion of "getopt.h" in msmtp.c: always include
  <getopt.h>

Version 1.3.3:
- replaced the GnuTLS check in configure.ac with the AM_PATH_LIBGNUTLS macro
  that comes with GnuTLS
- reorganized the man page
- added the Remote Message Queue Starting mode of operation (--rmqs, RFC 1985)
- fixed the --pretend option:
  - it now prohibits the execution of msmtp_serverinfo() even if --serverinfo
    was given
  - the printed configuration contains only the information that is actually
    used: DSN settings, envelope from address and other information is only
    printed when sendmail mode is active
- Added functions to get information about peer's certificate.
  This information is printed by --serverinfo and if --debug is used.
  This code requires a fix in gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid() that is only
  available in GnuTLS newer than the 2005-01-05 snapshot of what will become
  1.1.23.
- OpenSSL code in tls.c: allow Common Names of arbitrary length during 
  certificate check
- minor cleanups in net.c, tls.c, and msmtp.c
- improvements to the Windows mkstemp() replacement function in paths.c
- fixed a potential segmentation fault in DOS/DJGPP specific code in tempfile() 

Version 1.3.2:
- fixed segfault bug in find_account_by_envelope_from(): it was not checked 
  if the from address of an account is != NULL before doing a string comparison.
  Reported by Jan Kanty Palus.
- minor cleanup in find_account*() functions
- Removed TODO from distribution
- added the field 'conffile' to account_t for better error messages in
  msmtp.c
- added the field 'mask' to account_t and adjusted conf.c and msmtp.c
  accordingly
- Do not set GSASL_AUTHZID in GNU SASL authentication code. Only use
  GSASL_AUTHID. GSASL_AUTHZID caused DIGEST-MD5 to fail.
- Require GNU SASL >= 0.2.4, because it contains a new DIGEST-MD5
  implementation.
- Replaced base64.[ch] and md5_algo.[ch] with the gnulib modules base64 and
  md5. Moved md5_hmac() from md5_apps.c into smtp.c and removed md5_apps.[ch].
  Updated man page and AUTHORS accordingly. Removed README.md5.
- fixed interpretation of the SIZE SMTP service extension: no number means no
  information, 0 means no limit (RFC 1653).
- updated print_conf output (printed with --debug and --pretend) to match new
  configuration scheme
- added info about required libraries to README
- updated TODO
- fixed comment on msmtp_read_recipients() in msmtp.c

Version 1.3.1:
- fixed -t option address parsing; it was completely broken and didn't even
  catch all example cases from the RFC 2822 Appendix.
  
Version 1.3.0:
- minor changes to some documentation files (AUTHORS, README.dos, ...)
- The auth command is now required to activate authentication. It is not
  sufficient to use user/password anymore. This allows switching off
  authentication with --auth=off
- The tls_* properties can now be changed without activating tls. This allows
  switching TLS off with --tls=off.
- Added a command line long option for every configuration file command
- Changed log file information: Instead of conffile/account (which can now be
  overridden on the command line and thus has no meaning anymore), print
  host=%s tls=on|off auth=on|off from=%s
- Imported the gnulib module getopt: long option support for all platforms
- reactivated xmalloc.c to make the code more readable
- Support for the sendmail -t option (read additional recipients from the
  To, Cc, Bcc headers of the mail). This needs to create a temporary file for
  the mail headers.
- Use the same version of md5_apps.* that mpop uses
- Accept sendmail options.
  1. msmtp options that had to be changed because they collided with sendmail
     options:
     -p => -P
     -F => -C
     -v and -h were deleted.
  2. additional supported sendmail options:
     -t (read additional recipients from To, Cc, Bcc)
     -N (dsn_notify)
     -R (dsn_return)
     -X (set logfile)
  3. ignored options: a lot.
- Rewrote the "Using msmtp with Mutt" section of the man page. Updated
  Mutt+msmtp.txt and msmtprc.example.
- You can choose the account using the -f/--from option:
  If you use -f/--from but not -a/--account, the first account of the
  configuration file that has a matching envelope from address will be used.
  Thanks to Bernhard Walle and others for the idea.
- Rewrote expand_tilde() (from paths.c)
- Error handling: eliminated merror.[ch]. Replaced it by an int return value
  and an additional argument 'char *errstr' where necessary. Various minor 
  changes to error messages. Eliminated static buffer in tls.c.
- Allow sending of SMTP commands longer than 510 characters (SMTP_MAXCMDLEN).
  This is necessary for GSSAPI authentication.
- Added support for GSSAPI authentication with GNU SASL
- Added support for the ntlmdomain configuration command used by NTLM
  authentication.
- Check if the SMTP server supports a requested AUTH mechanism before sending
  an AUTH command. Changed both GNU SASL and built-in code.
- Updated the GNU SASL code in smtp.c to use the new API of GNU SASL 0.2.0. 
  The code will not work with 0.1.x anymore.
- Improved error message when the SMTP server sends an invalid reply
- Updated Mutt+msmtp.txt and msmtp.1
- Portability improvement: added missing declaration of h_errno to net.c. 
  Thanks to Marco for reporting this.
- New configure option --disable-win32-ipv6 to disable IPv6 on Windows and thus
  build binaries that run on any Windows version, not just XP and newer. See 
  the updated README.win32 file. Thanks to Thomas Davies for pointing out this 
  problem.

Version 1.2.4:
- Changed return code in case of authentication error from EX_DATAERR 
  to EX_NOPERM
- Changed return code in case of missing/invalid configuration file or 
  nonexistent account from EX_NOINPUT/EX_DATAERR to EX_CONFIG
- Test return value of localtime(3) in msmtp_log()
- Windows specific code in net.c: moved translation of error code from 
  WSAStartup() from net_lib_init() to wsa_strerror()
- OpenSSL specific code in tls.c: minor cleanup in openssl_io_error()
- Always keep control of the format string in calls to merror(). (There
  were four cases where the result of strerror() was passed as the format
  string in smtp.c.)  
- Clarified usage instructions of merror() in merror.h
- Check at initialization time whether support for a manually requested
  authentication mechanism is compiled, *before* establishing a network
  connection.
  This required a change from smtp_auth_caps() to the (equally trivial)
  smtp_authmech_is_supported() function.
  Made the output of both "not compiled in" messages (TLS and auth mech)
  consistent.
  The return code for these error conditions is EX_UNAVAILABLE now.
- Make the output of -h/--help and -v/--version consistent with the GNU 
  utilities by including copyright and no-warranty notice (version) and
  a short description and the bug report address (--help).
- Add missing declarations of optarg and optind to msmtp.c, needed for
  getopt() handling. No compiler complained so far, though.
- Fixed stupid error in smtp.c that prevented the detection of output 
  errors when sending the RCPT TO command (highly unlikely to occur).
- Cosmetic change in -v/--version output that avoids lines longer than 
  80 characters
- Fixed some man page typos
- Fixed typos in conffile.c error message
- Fixed typo in tls.c error message (OpenSSL code only)
- Changed error messages: "bla [blub]" -> "bla: blub"
- Improved some TLS error messages
- Corrected short description in man page, README and code comments
- Updated README.dos

Version 1.2.3:
- documentation updates
- The -v/--version option now prints information about the supported 
  authentication methods
- The tls_* commands and the auth mechanisms ntlm and digest-md5 are now
  allowed in the configuration file even if msmtp is compiled without
  support for TLS or GSASL. An error message will only appear only if you
  actually try to make use of a feature not compiled in.
- The GNU SASL code does not expect support for digest-md5 or ntlm (or 
  any other mechanism) in the library anymore. It just works with what's 
  supported. This means you can now use the packaged versions of GNU SASL
  from Gentoo and Debian sarge.
- Switch from gsasl_client_step_base64() to the newer gsasl_step64()
  in the GNU SASL authentication code
- Martin Hauke added README.hpux
- updated automake files to version 1.8.5
- configure.ac: check that pkg-config exists before trying to use it
- configure.ac: try to check for GNU SASL using pkg-config (if available)
- configure.ac: improved detection of network settings.
- configure.ac: improved checks for OpenSSL and GnuTLS
- configure.ac: fixed display of warning when neither OpenSSL nor GnuTLS 
  is found and --disable-ssl was not explicitly used
- updated README.win32, README.dos
- Use getaddrinfo() on Windows (but not gai_strerror()). This enables 
  IPv6 support for Windows.
- clarified an error message in tls.c (only OpenSSL affected):
  "cannot establish TLS connection" changed to "TLS handshake failed"

Version 1.2.2:
- set *error_msg to NULL in smtp_auth() and smtp_send_mail() to prevent 
  possible segfaults in the calling function
- correctly handle mails whose last line lacks a newline character (the 
  missing character will be added)
- smtp error messages are sanitized before printed in an error message or 
  to the logfile: non-printable characters (!isprint(c)) are replaced with
  a question mark.
- corrected a problem where the "exitcode=..." field in the logfile said 
  EX_SOFTWARE though the exitcode was in fact something different
- do not expect an SMTP response to end with '\n'; clarified comment about 
  smtp_get_msg() (Ralph Siemsen)
- added a "mailsize=..." field to the logfile
- added a "smtpmsg='...'" field to the logfile
- added a "errormsg='...'" field to the logfile
- the dash (-) as a logfile name causes logging to standard output
- removed all `...' quoting from error messages: `bla' -> bla
- updated documentation
  
Version 1.2.1:
- don't use -n option for echo in configure.ac, because it is not portable
- reduce calls to printf() in msmtp_serverinfo()
- correctly handle configuration files in which the last line does not end
  with a newline character
- update MD5 implementation to the version from popa3d-0.6.4.1, which has 
  a small fix (msmtp was not affected).

Version 1.2.0:
- changed output of -v,--version
- made TLS/SSL support optional: --disable-ssl disables it.
- moved md5.[ch] to md5_apps.[ch]
- added MD5 implementation by Solar Designer (files md5_algo.c and 
  md5_algo.h). It only gets used when
  - GNU SASL is not used and 
  - GnuTLS is not used and 
  - OpenSSL is not used and 
  - the C library does not implement MD5.
  See README.md5.
- print all debugging info to stdout (the SMTP session was printed to 
  stderr before).

Version 1.1.3:
- cosmetic changes in configure.ac
- cosmetic change in --serverinfo output
- new command: logfile (see man page)
- new option -i, which is ignored for compatibility with mail(1)
- made smtp_msg_status() available through smtp.h because the new 
  logging code needs it
- documentation updates
- translate SMTP_EINVAL to EX_DATAERR instead of EX_SOFTWARE in 
  exitcode_smtp() in msmtp.c

Version 1.1.2:
- changed the net_getline() and tls_getline() funtions to the slightly 
  different net_gets()/tls_gets() functions to clean things up and 
  prevent minor possible bugs
- various minor cleanups and portability improvements
- updated documentation. msmtp now accepts the example configuration 
  file ;-)

Version 1.1.1:
- many minor cleanups
- fixed a bug where error messages might get overwriten by further 
  error messages in msmtp.c
- tls_nostarttls now also changes the default port to 465 (ssmtp).

Version 1.1.0:
- restructured everything to use a new error handling scheme
- restructured TLS interface
- rewrote SMTP protocol implementation
- added SMTP PIPELINING support
- added new option -S, --serverinfo, which prints information about the
  SMTP server.
- changed option -f, --file to -F, --file
- added new option -f, --from to set the envelope from address. The from
  address does not need to be set in the configuration file anymore.
  The command line address overrides the configuration file setting.  
- removed check for vasprintf() in configure.ac; it is not used anymore
- removed check for strcasecmp() in configure.ac
- the tilde expansion now uses getpwuid() when $HOME is not set on UNIX

Version 1.0.0:
- correctly handle certificate chains in tls.c GnuTLS code
- added tilde expansion to configuration file filenames (expand_tilde() 
  in path.c)
- return EX_IOERR instead of other exit codes on read errors in esmtp.c
- case insensitive parsing of EHLO response
- fall back to HELO if EHLO fails
- removed check for vsnprintf() in configure.ac
- updated automake
- removed names of failed functions from error messages (Example:
  "cannot get system time [time(): %s]" -> "cannot get system time [%s]")
- slightly improved error messages in net.c
- minor man page improvements
- updated README.gsasl

Version 0.7.2:
- minor man page improvements
- additional eror check in smtp_copy_mail()
- removed unneeded msmtp.h
- moved cram_md5.* to md5.* and renamed cram_md5() to hmac_md5()
- cleaned up conditional compilation of base64.c and md5.c
- documentation updates
- cleaned up configure.ac
- new files paths.[ch] for OS dependend path functions
- added support for MinGW to build native Win32 application -- see README.win32
- added support for DJGPP to build native DOS application -- see README.dos
- fixed a bug in tls.c: wrong test for RAND_status() (OpenSSL code).
  This only affected the new DOS port (see next point).
- added code to seed the OpenSSL pseudo random number generator. This code is
  only used when OpenSSL cannot seed the PRNG itself. This means the code is
  probably only ever used on DOS.

Version 0.7.1:
- new command 'domain' to set the EHLO parameter
- new options --pretend and --debug (thanks to David MacMahon)
- minimal change in --version behaviour: print package name, not name of binary
  file

Version 0.7.0:
- Added support for DSN (Delivery Status Notification) via the new configuration
  commands 'dsn_return' and 'dsn_notify' (changes in conffile.[ch], msmtp.c,
  esmtp.[ch])
- configuration: added 'tls_nocertcheck' which disables all server 
  certificate checks (changes in conffile.[ch], msmtp.c, esmtp.[ch], tls.[ch]).
- configuration: renamed 'nostarttls' to 'tls_nostarttls'
- documentation updates
- fixed a minor bug in an OpenSSL error report
- minor --help text change
- minor cleanups in conffile.c

Version 0.6.6:
- fixed building on Solaris (and maybe other systems)

Version 0.6.5:
- License clarification: msmtp is released under the GPL with the additional
  exemption that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
- Updated tls.c and cram_md5.c to work with gnutls >=1.0.0 and libgcrypt 
  >=1.1.90. The code will not work with older versions anymore!
- Use gethostbyname() in net.c if getaddrinfo() is not available. This allows
  msmtp to be compiled on older systems and systems that don't have proper IPv6
  support, for example Cygwin.
- Accept arbitrary long input lines in the mail (new function smtp_copy_mail()).
  The MUA is responsible for the RFC conformance of mails (no line longer than 
  998 characters).
- improved error messages in case of SMTP responses that are too long
- improved error messages in tls.c
- increased SMTP buffer size in esmtp.c
- Make check of return code of vasprintf() more portable in xmalloc.c
- cleaned up esmtp.h
- changed --help text

Version 0.6.4:
- fixed a bug in conffile.c
- report missing arguments in conffile.c

Version 0.6.3:
- man page improvements
- reset error_lines to NULL in merror.c in print_error_lines() to allow
  further calls to add_error_line() (not yet needed in msmtp)
- free memory in case of tls_init() failure in msmtp.c
- fixed --disable-gsasl configure option
- #include <unistd.h> in msmtp.c because Mac OS X has getopt() there (Randolph
  Fritz). (This applies to all systems that don't have getopt.h).
- return EX_OK instead of 0 in some functions in esmtp.c

Version 0.6.2:
- added support for GNU Autotools (Christophe Nowicki)
- the GNU getopt sources are no longer included; msmtp will fall back to short 
  options when getopt_long is not available (Christophe Nowicki)
- fixed a bug in the certificate check/verification code that prevented 
  msmtp from accepting a wildcard in the Common Name (CN) field (this 
  affected only the OpenSSL version of the code)
- wrapped some lines in the man page (example section)
- updated documentation
  
Version 0.6.1:
- free x509_cert in OpenSSL code of tls_cert_check()
- always check x509_subject common name for hostname matching in OpenSSL code
  of tls_cert_check() (like the GnuTLS code does).
- improved CN/hostname matching in OpenSSL code: it is now case insensitive
  and allows the * wildcard as the left-most character in the CN (RFC 2595)
- check for x509_subject == NULL in OpenSSL code of tls_cert_check()
- moved tls_init()/tls_deinit() from smtp_send() to main()
- removed tls dependencies from net.c
- change comments/code/documentation to read GSASL instead of GnuSASL

Version 0.6.0:
- Added GnuTLS/libgcrypt support to tls.c and cram_md5.c
  You can now choose whether you want to use GnuTLS/libgcrypt or OpenSSL 
  for TLS support and CRAM-MD5 authentication (see Makefile).
- Added sanity checks of server certificate when using TLS.
- Added the tls_trust_file command.
  This enables strict verification of the server certificate.
- Added tls_key_file/tls_cert_file commands.
  These commands enable msmtp to send a client certificate to the server if 
  requested.
- Optional support for GSASL. When used, it replaces the built-in
  PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication code and adds support for
  DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM.
- The EHLO response is now taken into account:
  - The STARTTLS command will only be sent if the server supports it
  - If no authentication method was specified, the best one that is supported
    by the server will be chosen.
- Removed the ability to choose the TLS method with the tls command. This was
  not completely implementable with GnuTLS (since it lacks SSLv2 support afaik)
  and is unnecessary anyway. The best method available is automatically chosen.
- Changed configuration file parsing: Now arguments may contain spaces and may
  be enclosed in double quotes (to allow leading or ending blanks in an 
  argument).
- Reorganized Makefile to support the new configuration options (GSASL/GnuTLS).
- Removed unnecessary #includes from cram_md5.c
- Updated documentation

Version 0.5.3:
- Fixed RFC2821 violations in the "MAIL FROM:" and "RCPT TO:" commands.
- Fixed RFC2487 SHOULD-clause violation: Now send EHLO again after
  successful TLS handshake.

Version 0.5.2:
- fixed stupid bugs in base64dec() and cram_md5() that sometimes caused
  CRAM-MD5 authentication to fail.

Version 0.5.1:
- man page corrections and improvements
- improved error messages
- moved msmtp.html to msmtp.1.html

Version 0.5.0:
- Switched from commandline configuration to a configuration file
  (~/.msmtprc). This improves security (no authentication data on the
  commandline) and allows easy setup of multiple accounts.  
  The only options are --help, --version, --file, --account now.

Version 0.4.2:
- Security fix: delete username and password information from the commandline
  after they have been extracted, so that this information is not visible per
  ps / top anymore.
  It is still possible to see the length of the authentication information via
  /proc/pid/cmdline in Linux.
  The real fix is to move all sensitive data into a configuration file. This
  is planned for 0.5.0.
  
Version 0.4.1:
- improved error handling in non-TLS net i/o
- the code that removes the Bcc header was updated to conform to RFC 2822,
  section 2.2.3. It now allows continued Bcc header lines to start with ' ' or
  '\t' (previously only '\t' was allowed).
- properly close TLS connection at the end of smtp_send()
- minor cleanups
- minor man page improvements

Version 0.4.0:
- changed the short version of --keep-bcc to -k (as documented in the man page)
- cleaned up the choice of the authentication method in msmtp.c
- changed tls_start() to use tls_io_error() for SSL_connect() errors
- fixed a segfault bug with failing tls_start() that was introduced in 0.3.1
- added --nostarttls option (Kai)
- updated man page to clarify the use of optional arguments (Kai)

Version 0.3.1:
- code cleanups
- documentation improvements
- --help text improvements
- added instructions on how to find out system specific settings to the 
  Makefile
- changed tls.[ch] to hide OpenSSL specific details.
- improved TLS input/output error reporting
- fixed a minor bug in the error handling of tls_start()
- improved error reporting in smtp_get_response()
- fixed minor off-by-one bug in smtp_put() (the check for the return value of 
  vsnprintf() was wrong). This bug would have been triggered if you used an 
  extremely long username for authentication (longer than ca. 950 characters).

Version 0.3.0:
- remove Bcc header by default
- added --keep-bcc to keep the Bcc header.
- fixed handling of lines beginning with a dot
- added GNU getopt source for systems that don't have it
- added xvasprintf/xasprintf() to xmalloc.c
- cleaned up xmalloc.c
- changed merror.c to use xvasprintf()
- open_socket() improvements (now uses getaddrinfo() for protocol independence
  and portability)
- Makefile changes (support for more platforms)
- documentation updates

Version 0.2.6:
- added support for IPv6
- documentation update

Version 0.2.5:
- fixed handling of optional arguments for short options
- fixed error handling for gethostbyname()
- minor documentation changes
- renamed smtp.[ch] to esmtp.[ch]
- improved error reporting in smtp_auth_plain()

Version 0.2.4:
- minor error message changes
- minor documentation changes
- cleanups in tls.c
- error handling changes and fixes in tls.c
- fixed potential problems reported by NetBSD's lint(1)
- moved choice of secure authentication method from smtp.c to msmtp.c

Version 0.2.3:
- changed behaviour of --auth: does not accept 'none' anymore,
  no argument means choose a *secure* method.
- changed behaviour of --tls: does not accept 'any', 'none'
  anymore, no argument means choose best method available.
- documentation updates and minor changes
- minor Makefile tweaks
- now use die() to exit in case of memory allocation failure 
- minor tls.c cleanups
- fixed stupid minor bug regarding base64dec()

Version 0.2.2:
- minor change to the Makefile
- minor change to the man page
- minor changes to unify error messages
- close connection on errors in smtp_send()

Version 0.2.1:
- support for AUTH PLAIN
- documentation fixes, updates and cleanups.
- fixed memory leak in smtp_auth_login()
- fixed stupid bug regarding base64enc()
- clean up smtp_auth_cram_md5()

Version 0.2.0:
- AUTH CRAM-MD5 support
- new option (--auth) to choose the authentication method
- support for --version and --help if one of them is the only argument
- documentation fixes / improvements
- better error messages
- Makefile fixes

Version 0.1.1:
- documentation updates / fixes
- better error handling in start_tls()
- adjust MAX_SMTP_LINELEN in smtp.c
