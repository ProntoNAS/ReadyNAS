The built-in authentication code supports the PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, and 
EXTERNAL mechanisms.

If you compile msmtp with GNU SASL support instead, you can use any of the
following mechanisms if they are supported by your version of libgsasl: 
EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, LOGIN, and NTLM.
Use the --version option to find out which methods are supported.

You need gsasl or libgsasl version 0.2.4 or higher.
