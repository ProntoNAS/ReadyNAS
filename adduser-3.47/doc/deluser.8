.TH DELUSER 8 "Version VERSION" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH NAME
deluser, delgroup \- remove a user or group from the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR deluser " [options] [\-\-remove-home] [--remove-all-files] [\-\-backup] user"
.PP
.BR deluser " \-\-group [options] group"
.br
.BR delgroup " [options] group"
.PP
.BR deluser " [options] user group"
.SS COMMON OPTIONS
.br
[\-\-quiet] [\-\-help] [\-\-version] [\-\-conf FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR deluser " and " delgroup
remove users and groups from the system according to command line options
and configuration information in
.IR /etc/deluser.conf .
They are friendlier front ends to the
.BR userdel " and " groupdel
programs, removing the home directory as option or even all files on the system
owned by the user to be removed, running a custom script, and other features.
.BR deluser " and " delgroup
can be run in one of three modes:
.SS "Remove a normal user"
If called with one non-option argument and without the
.BR " \-\-group " options, " deluser
will remove a normal user.

By default,
.B deluser
will remove the user without removing the home directory, the mail spool  or
any other files on the system owned by the user. Removing the home directory
and mail spool can be archieved using the
.B \-\-remove-home
option and removing all files on the system owned by the user by the
.B \-\-remove-all-files
option. Note that if you activate both options
.B \-\-remove-home
will have no effect because all files including the home directory and mail
spool are already covered by the
.B \-\-remove-all-files
option.

If you want to backup all files before deleting them you can activate the
.B \-\-backup
option which will create a file username.tar(.gz|.bz2) in your current
working directory. Both the remove and backup options can also be activated
for default in the configuration file /etc/deluser.conf. See
.B deluser.conf(5)
for details.

If the file
.B /usr/local/sbin/deluser.local
exists, it will be executed after the user account has been removed
in order to do any local setup. The arguments passed to
.B deluser.local
are:
.br
username uid gid home-directory

.SS "Remove a system group"
If 
.BR deluser " is called with the " \-\-group " option, or " delgroup
is called, a system group will be removed.

Warning: If any users have the group to be removed as primary group
the group cannot be removed.

.SS "Remove an user from a specific group"
If called with two non-option arguments,
.B deluser
will remove an user from a specific group.
