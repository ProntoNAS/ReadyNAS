    fixes were made I really want to get have in woody. They are quite
    unlikely to break stuff.

adduser (3.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * If --no-create-home is specified, adduser doesn't warn about an
    existing home directory anymore.
  * Also fixed some stupid mistake so that the verbose information that
    a system user already exists is printed probably. Closes: #112477.
  * Fixed broken reference to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL in
    debian/copyright.

adduser (3.41) unstable; urgency=low

    sub directories are process before their parent directories.
    Closes: #102929.
  * Don't copy *.dpkg-* files from skel. Closes: #105453.
  * Fixed Polish Debconf templates file. Closes: #107764.

    current adduser version since I'm working on a rewrite with a more
    flexible design.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Aug 2001 11:08:14 +0200

    back from vacation.

adduser (3.39) unstable; urgency=medium

    I don't have my key here at LSM, this package is uploaded by
    Martin Michlmayr...
  * Debconf stuff and /etc/adduser.conf is purged in postrm if the
    package is purged. Closes: #101811.
  * Fixed typo (NISERVER instead of NISCONFIG) in AdduserCommon.pm.
    Closes: #101900.

adduser (3.37) unstable; urgency=medium

  * -h now does the same as --help. Closes: #98789.
  * make -C /var/yp is only called if adduser is run on a NIS server.
    Thanks to Herbert Xu and Miquel van Smoorenburg for their helpful
    tips on how to check this most reliable. Currently this is done
    everytime invalidate_nscd() is called which probably doesn't
    improve the performance a lot. :-/ I couldn't figure out if there
    are static variable (like in the C function scope), and using a
    global variable is not optimal either. We have too much of that old
    cruft anyway which should be cleaned up. Should be improved later.
    Closes: #97981.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Sun, 27 May 2001 20:34:00 -0500

adduser (3.36) unstable; urgency=medium

  * make -C /var/yp is called when invalidating nscd cache. Thanks to
    Juergen Fischer for testing. Closes: #22412
  * Included example adduser.local script from John Zaitseff.
    Closes: #94245

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Wed,  9 May 2001 16:28:02 -0500

adduser (3.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed unnecessary dependency on perl since perl-base should be
    sufficient. Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing that out. I suspect 
    we need a versioned dependency on perl-base though since older
    perl versions don't look in /usr/share/perl5.
  * Updated usage text for --shell and --disabled-login options.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Sun,  6 May 2001 16:16:06 -0500

adduser (3.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Temporary fix for French translation to display [y/n] instead of
    [o/n] when asking if chfn information is correct since the yes
    thing is hard-coded at the moment. At the moment the best solution
    I can think of would be having a "yes" and "no" in the .po files
    and grabbing the first letter to generate [o/n] for French e.g.
    Closes: #87596.
  * Added Romanian translation of Debconf translates. Closes: #93601.
  * Added a sentence to Debconf template homedir-permission that it
    only affects users added later, and syncronised the German template
    for this change. Closes: #88292.
  * Adduser now understands --shell to override the login shell specified
    in the configuration file. adduser.8 is updated, too.
  * Added new options --disabled-login which does what
    --disabled-password previously did. --disabled-password not sets the
    password to '*' in the shadow file and thus logins via SSH RSA keys
    e.g. are still possible. Closes: #77817.
  * Got rid of bashism in debian/rules 

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Thu,  3 May 2001 19:39:18 -0500

adduser (3.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/adduser.conf is not marked as a conffile anymore. Instead, it
    is moved to /usr/share/doc/adduser/examples/adduser.conf and will
    be copied in postinst if it does not exist already.
  * Fixed another error in postinst when receiving the status if DIR_MODE
    was changed in /etc/adduser.conf.
  * Debconf template now talks about "system wide readable homedirs",
    instead of world-wide ones. This description is more appropriate.
    Closes: #81812
  * Added German translation for the Debconf template.
  * Added explaination to adduser.8 that if invoked with --system and
    the given parameters match with the password file, adduser exists
    silently. Closes: #81300.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Jan 2001 22:54:54 -0600

adduser (3.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * deluser: Fixed tar -I problem. Now the files are first 'tar'ed and
    then compressed with bzip2 or gzip.
  * deluser: Homedirectory is now backup probably using File::Find::find
  * adduser: Introduced the options --firstuid and --lastuid similar to
    the patch in BTS. Closes: #81352.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Jan 2001 13:15:07 -0600

adduser (3.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed nscd variable scope problem: $nscd, holding the path to the
    nscd binary was defined 'my' inside an if-construct.
  * Type in manpage deluser.8 fixed and some a sentence on how the
    compression method is chosen in deluser added to deluser.conf.5

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Dec 2000 23:57:17 -0600

adduser (3.26) unstable; urgency=low

    backup directories anymore. Closes: #79791.

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Dec 2000 01:20:08 -0600

adduser (3.25) unstable; urgency=high

  * adduser: checks for nscd in /usr/bin/nscd and /usr/sbin/nscd.
  * adduser: nscd is invoked with system instead of systemcall, thus
    adduser doesn't clean up in case nscd returned an error. Closes: #77927.
  * adduser: if invoked with --system and the uid is correct, adduser
    exits silently and thus makes it easier for postinsts to make sure
    that there will be a user with correct parameters. Closes: #79371.
  * deluser: security bug for option REMOVE_ALL_FILES fixed. rm was
    invoked insecurely, like system("rm $files"). rm is no longer used to
    delete files, but they are directly unlink()ed. Closes: #79526.
  * deluser: external find call for searching for the users files when
    using REMOVE_ALL_FILES is replaced through File::Find::find()
  * deluser: insecure calling of tar fixed. This was the same problem as
    with rm.

    wrong permissions if adduser.conf is old (closes: #66583)

 -- Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Jun 2000 18:06:18 +0200

adduser (3.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * adduser has a better handling for nscd now. Instead of simply
    stopping nscd before changes and starting it again after changes,
    adduser invalidates the caches before and after changes now.
    (closes: #54726)
  * deluser invalidates nscd caches after changes, too.
  * new Portugese/Brazilian translation for adduser and deluser by
    Cesar Eduardo Barros <cesarb@nitnet.com.br>
  * adding and removing users to/from a group is now done with gpasswd
    instead of usermod. This prevents adduser and deluser from not
    adding "NISed" users to a group (closes: #57573)
  * functions used in both adduser and deluser moved to AdduserCommon.pm
