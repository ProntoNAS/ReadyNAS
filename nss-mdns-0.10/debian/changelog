nss-mdns (0.10-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Rework the build process completely to be able to build multiple flavors;
    build a "main" flavor and an addition "m32" flavor for amd64 which is
    installed in a new lib32nss-mdns package for 32-bits compatibility;
    build-depend on gcc-mutilib; initial patch proposed by Goswin von
    Brederlow; closes: #410052.

nss-mdns (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set Utopia Maintenance Team as Maintainer and add Sjoerd and myself as
    Uploaders.
  * Ack NMU.
  * Bump Debhelper compatibility level to 5.
  * Misc cleanups.
  * Wrap fields in control.
  * Add ${misc:Depends}.
  * Switch to a multi-binaries layout for the packaging.
  * Split the definition of configure flags and LDFLAGS.
  * Drop -DNDEBUG=1 from CFLAGS; seems risky in a package build.
  * Only pass --host to configure if DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE
    differ.
  * Add watch file.

nss-mdns (0.9-0.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix a RC bug.
  * Configure with a prefix of / instead of /usr as libnss-mdns needs to be in
    /lib for the resolver to work correctly during boot; this is also needed
    for chrooted processes such as Postfix's smtpd which uses a copy of the
    NSS libs as well of the NSS configuration and fails when mdns is missing
    in the chroot but referenced in nsswitch.conf.  Update other configured
    dirs (mandir, infodir, sysconfdir) as well, but these are currently not
    used.

nss-mdns (0.9-0.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix broken dependencies in the 0.8-6.1 NMU.
  * Fix Depends on perl and avahi-daemon.
  * Bump up dependency on avahi-daemon to >= 0.6.16-1 for the auto-disabling
    functionality on sites with a .local SOA.
  * New upstream release.
    - Does not export unnecessary symbols and fixes segfault in nmbclient
      which had symbols with the same name; closes: #404266.
    - Does not use the "search" keyword of resolv.conf anymore;
      closes: #404534, #405327.
  * Re-add a postrm to cleanup the mdns_* entries from nsswitch.conf but act on
    package removal instead of purge to avoid breaking the DNS when the lib is
    removed and to ensure perl is still present; closes: #406198.
  * Document the changes made to postinst in NOTES.Debian and document the
    history of the postrm as well.
  * Updates to README.Debian; add upstream URL for troubleshooting.

nss-mdns (0.8-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix a long-standing RC bug and to beat the
    package into shape before etch with suggestions from upstream; thanks
    Lennart Poettering.
  * Configure with --disable-legacy, as recommended by upstream for security
    reasons; the legacy mode might be offered in a separate binary package for
    the corner cases where it can be useful; see full discussion in #393711;
    depend on avahi-daemon as nss-mdns will not work without avahi when
    compiled like this; closes: #399297.
  * Only suggest zeroconf instead of Recommending it: even if it can act as a
    nice complement to nss-mdns, it is intrusive and orthogonal to nss-mdns
    and conflicts with avahi-autoipd; closes: #353131, #392590.
  * Suggest avahi-autoipd as an alternative to zeroconf.
  * Remove offensive comments in postinst and README.Debian.
  * Document the history of postinst snippets in debian/NOTES.Debian to permit
    handling all upgrade paths.
  * Depend on Perl for the postinst snippets using the perl interpreter.
  * Rewrite postinst to handle all upgrade paths.
    - Does not wipe NSS configuration which matches the upstream recommended
      configuration during upgrades from versions 0.8-4.2 or 0.8-5;
      closes: #393608.
    - Install the upstream recommended configuration for first installs and
      upgrades from versions which did not automatically insert mdns in the
      NSS setup (unless mdns is already setup); closes: #393711.
    - Keep configuration intact when upgrading from versions which installed
      the upstream recommended configuration.
    - Remove whitespaces added in upgrades from version 0.8-4.2 or 0.8-5 to
      0.8-6.
    - For upgrades from 0.8-6, attempt to revert the problematic "mdns_minimal
      dns mdns" configuration and to install the upstream recommended
      configuration.
  * Update README.Debian to match the above changes and a planned changes in
    avahi-daemon which should disable itself if a .local SOA is found after a
    change in the DNS settings.

nss-mdns (0.8-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert hostile package takeover.
  * "Unbreak the world" (Closes: #392813)
  
  "So whether nss-mdns does or doesn't support "search local" is of no 
  concern to me -- I just doesn't want it to interfere with my otherwise 
  working setup."
  
    Walter Hofmann on Joey Hess and Sjoerd Simons' period of maintainence
  
  * Revert switch to CDBS.
  * Switch to using a sane /etc/nsswitch.conf
    so we don't break existing setups, or those over which the user has
    no control.
  * Revert "clarifications" as well.
  * Recommend, once again, zeroconf.

nss-mdns (0.8-4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Add postinst that will add mdns entries to /etc/nsswitch.conf on new
    installs and on upgrades from the previous version.  Closes: #388864,
    #351990
  * Add postrm to remove mdns entries from /etc/nsswitch.conf when the package
    is removed.
  * Local modifications to the file will be preserved accross upgrades.
  * Depend on base-files 3.1.10 or higher to get a nsswitch.conf that is not a
    conffile and that doesn't have mdns entries from base-files in it.
  * Switch to nsswitch line recommended by upstream in #388864 after getting
    clarification from upstream, and update README.Debian.
  * Remove recommends on zeroconf. Closes: #353131

nss-mdns (0.8-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

nss-mdns (0.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copy 'configure' from the upstream tarball since the CDBS regeneration has
    gone awry and does not work. This is the simple fix -- a more robust one
    will be in place shortly. Thanks to Sam Morris for the diagnosis.

    can now be mentioned in /etc/nsswitch.conf without issue.
