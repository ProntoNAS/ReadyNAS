What is Kerberos and How Does it Work?
======================================

Kerberos V5 is based on the Kerberos authentication system developed at
MIT.  Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service)
sends a request for a ticket to the Key Distribution Center (KDC).  The
KDC creates a "ticket-granting ticket" (TGT) for the client, encrypts
it using the client's password as the key, and sends the encrypted TGT
back to the client.  The client then attempts to decrypt the TGT, using
its password.  If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (i.e., if
the client gave the correct password), it keeps the decrypted TGT,
which indicates proof of the client's identity.

The TGT, which expires at a specified time, permits the client to obtain
additional tickets, which give permission for specific services.  The
requesting and granting of these additional tickets is user-transparent.

Why Should I use Kerberos?
==========================

Since Kerberos negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted,
communications between two points anywhere on the Internet, it provides
a layer of security that is not dependent on which side of a firewall
either client is on.  Since studies have shown that half of the computer
security breaches in industry happen from inside firewalls, Kerberos V5
from MIT will play a vital role in the security of your network.

Please Read the Documentation
=============================

As with any software package that uses a centrallized database, the
installation procedure is somewhat involved, and requires forethought
and planning.  MIT has attempted to make this Kerberos V5 Installation
Guide as concise as possible, rather than making it an exhaustive
description of the details of Kerberos.  Consequently, everything in
this guide appears because MIT believes that it is important.  Please
read and follow these instructions carefully.

This document is one piece of the document set for Kerberos V5.  The
documents, and their intended audiences, are:

   * Kerberos V5 Installation Guide:  a concise guide for installing
     Kerberos V5.  Kerberos administrators (particularly whoever will be
     making site-wide decisions about the installation) and the system
     administrators who will be installing the software should read this
     guide.

   * Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide:  a sysadmin's guide to
     administering a Kerberos installation.  The System Administrator's
     Guide describes the administration software and suggests policies
     and procedures for administering a Kerberos installation.  Anyone
     who will have administrative access to your Kerberos database
     should read this guide.

   * Kerberos V5 UNIX User's Guide:  a guide to using the Kerberos UNIX
     client programs.  All users on UNIX systems should read this guide,
     particularly the "Tutorial" section.

Overview of This Guide
======================

The next chapter describes the decisions you need to make before
installing Kerberos V5.

Chapter three provided instructions for building the Kerberos sources.

Chapter four describes installation procedures for each class of
Kerberos machines:

  1. Key Distribution Centers (KDCs).

       A. The Master KDC.

Realm Configuration Decisions
*****************************

Before installing Kerberos V5, it is necessary to consider the
following issues:

   * The name of your Kerberos realm (or the name of each realm, if you
     need more than one).

   * How you will map your hostnames onto Kerberos realms.

   * Which ports your KDC and and kadmin (database access) services
     will use.

   * How many slave KDCs you need and where they should be located.

   * The hostnames of your master and slave KDCs.

   * How frequently you will propagate the database from the master KDC
     to the slave KDCs.

Kerberos Realms
===============

Although your Kerberos realm can be any ASCII string, convention is to
make it the same as your domain name, in upper-case letters.  For
example, hosts in the domain example.com would be in the Kerberos realm
EXAMPLE.COM.

If you need multiple Kerberos realms, MIT recommends that you use
descriptive names which end with your domain name, such as
BOSTON.EXAMPLE.COM and HOUSTON.EXAMPLE.COM.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Next: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Prev: Kerberos Realms,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms
======================================

Mapping hostnames onto Kerberos realms is done in one of two ways.

The first mechanism, which has been in use for years in MIT-based
Kerberos distributions, works through a set of rules in the `krb5.conf'
configuration file.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)  You can specify mappings for
an entire domain or subdomain, and/or on a hostname-by-hostname basis.
Since greater specificity takes precedence, you would do this by
specifying the mappings for a given domain or subdomain and listing the
exceptions.

The second mechanism works by looking up the information in special
`TXT' records in the Domain Name Service.  This is currently not used
by default because security holes could result if the DNS TXT records
were spoofed.  If this mechanism is enabled on the client, it will try
to look up a `TXT' record for the DNS name formed by putting the prefix
`_kerberos' in front of the hostname in question.  If that record is
not found, it will try using `_kerberos' and the host's domain name,
then its parent domain, and so forth.  So for the hostname
BOSTON.ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM, the names looked up would be:

     _kerberos.boston.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.foobar.com
     _kerberos.com

The value of the first TXT record found is taken as the realm name.
(Obviously, this doesn't work all that well if a host and a subdomain
have the same name, and different realms.  For example, if all the hosts
in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM domain are in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM
realm, but a host named ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM is for some reason in
another realm.  In that case, you would set up TXT records for all
hosts, rather than relying on the fallback to the domain name.)

Even if you do not choose to use this mechanism within your site, you
may wish to set it up anyway, for use when interacting with other sites.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Next: Slave KDCs,  Prev: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

Ports for the KDC and Admin Services
====================================

The default ports used by Kerberos are port 88 for the KDC(1)  and port
749 for the admin server.  You can, however, choose to run on other
ports, as long as they are specified in each host's `/etc/services' and
`krb5.conf' files, and the `kdc.conf' file on each KDC.  For a more
thorough treatment of port numbers used by the Kerberos V5 programs,
refer to the "Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5"
section of the `Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide'.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Kerberos V4 used port 750.  If necessary, you can run on both ports
for backward compatibility.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Slave KDCs,  Next: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Prev: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

Slave KDCs
==========

Slave KDCs provide an additional source of Kerberos ticket-granting
services in the event of inaccessibility of the master KDC.  The number
of slave KDCs you need and the decision of where to place them, both
physically and logically, depends on the specifics of your network.

All of the Kerberos authentication on your network requires that each
client be able to contact a KDC.  Therefore, you need to anticipate any
likely reason a KDC might be unavailable and have a slave KDC to take up
the slack.

Some considerations include:

   * Have at least one slave KDC as a backup, for when the master KDC is
     down, is being upgraded, or is otherwise unavailable.

   * If your network is split such that a network outage is likely to
     cause a network partition (some segment or segments of the network
     to become cut off or isolated from other segments), have a slave
     KDC accessible to each segment.

   * If possible, have at least one slave KDC in a different building
     from the master, in case of power outages, fires, or other
     localized disasters.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Next: Database Propagation,  Prev: Slave KDCs,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs
=======================================

MIT recommends that your KDCs have a predefined set of CNAME records
(DNS hostname aliases), such as `kerberos' for the master KDC and
`kerberos-1', `kerberos-2', ... for the slave KDCs.  This way, if you
need to swap a machine, you only need to change a DNS entry, rather
than having to change hostnames.

A new mechanism for locating KDCs of a realm through DNS has been added
to the MIT Kerberos V5 distribution.  A relatively new record type
called `SRV' has been added to DNS.  Looked up by a service name and a
domain name, these records indicate the hostname and port number to
contact for that service, optionally with weighting and prioritization.
(See RFC 2782 if you want more information.  You can follow the
example below for straightforward cases.)

The use with Kerberos is fairly straightforward.  The domain name used
in the SRV record name is the domain-style Kerberos realm name.  (It is
possible to have Kerberos realm names that are not DNS-style names, but
we don't recommend it for Internet use, and our code does not support it
well.)  Several different Kerberos-related service names are used:

`_kerberos._udp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by UDP.  This entry will be used
     the most often.  Normally you should list port 88 on each of your
     KDCs.

`_kerberos._tcp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by TCP.  The MIT KDC by default
     will not listen on any TCP ports, so unless you've changed the
     configuration or you're running another KDC implementation, you
     should leave this unspecified.  If you do enable TCP support,
     normally you should use port 88.

`_kerberos-master._udp'
     This entry should refer to those KDCs, if any, that will
     immediately see password changes to the Kerberos database.  This
     entry is used only in one case, when the user is logging in and
     the password appears to be incorrect; the master KDC is then
     contacted, and the same password used to try to decrypt the
     response, in case the user's password had recently been changed
     and the first KDC contacted hadn't been updated.  Only if that
     fails is an "incorrect password" error given.

     If you have only one KDC, or for whatever reason there is no
     accessible KDC that would get database changes faster than the
     others, you do not need to define this entry.

`_kerberos-adm._tcp'
     This should list port 749 on your master KDC.  Support for it is
     not complete at this time, but it will eventually be used by the
     `kadmin' program and related utilities.  For now, you will also
     need the `admin_server' entry in `krb5.conf'.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)

`_kpasswd._udp'
     This should list port 464 on your master KDC.  It is used when a
     user changes her password.


Be aware, however, that the DNS SRV specification requires that the
hostnames listed be the canonical names, not aliases.  So, for example,
you might include the following records in your (BIND-style) zone file:

     $ORIGIN foobar.com.
     _kerberos               TXT       "FOOBAR.COM"
     kerberos                CNAME     daisy
     kerberos-1              CNAME     use-the-force-luke
     kerberos-2              CNAME     bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos._udp          SRV       0 0 88 daisy
                             SRV       0 0 88 use-the-force-luke
                             SRV       0 0 88 bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos-master._udp   SRV       0 0 88 daisy
     _kerberos-adm._tcp      SRV       0 0 749 daisy
     _kpasswd._udp           SRV       0 0 464 daisy

As with the DNS-based mechanism for determining the Kerberos realm of a
host, we recommend distributing the information this way for use by
other sites that may want to interact with yours using Kerberos, even if
you don't immediately make use of it within your own site.  If you
anticipate installing a very large number of machines on which it will
be hard to update the Kerberos configuration files, you may wish to do
all of your Kerberos service lookups via DNS and not put the information
(except for `admin_server' as noted above) in future versions of your
`krb5.conf' files at all.  Eventually, we hope to phase out the listing
of server hostnames in the client-side configuration files; making
preparations now will make the transition easier in the future.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Database Propagation,  Prev: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

Database Propagation
====================

The Kerberos database resides on the master KDC, and must be propagated
regularly (usually by a cron job) to the slave KDCs.  In deciding how
frequently the propagation should happen, you will need to balance the
amount of time the propagation takes against the maximum reasonable
amount of time a user should have to wait for a password change to take
effect.

If the propagation time is longer than this maximum reasonable time
(e.g., you have a particularly large database, you have a lot of
slaves, or you experience frequent network delays), you may wish to cut
down on your propagation delay by performing the propagation in
parallel.  To do this, have the master KDC propagate the database to one
set of slaves, and then have each of these slaves propagate the database
to additional slaves.

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The appl Directory,  Next: The clients Directory,  Prev: Organization of the Source Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The appl Directory
------------------

The appl directory contains sample Kerberos application client and
server programs.  In previous releases, it contained Kerberized versions
of remote access daemons, but those have now been moved to a separate
project.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The clients Directory,  Next: The gen-manpages Directory,  Prev: The appl Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The clients Directory
---------------------

This directory contains the code for several user-oriented programs.

kdestroy
     This program destroys the user's active Kerberos authorization
     tickets.  MIT recommends that users `kdestroy' before logging out.

kinit
     This program prompts users for their Kerberos principal name and
     password, and attempts to get an initial ticket-granting-ticket
     for that principal.

klist
     This program lists the Kerberos principal and Kerberos tickets
     held in a credentials cache, or the keys held in a keytab file.

kpasswd
     This program changes a user's Kerberos password.

ksu
     This program is a Kerberized version of the `su' program that is
     meant to securely change the real and effective user ID to that of
     the target user and to create a new security context.

kvno
     This program acquires a service ticket for the specified Kerberos
     principals and prints out the key version numbers of each.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The gen-manpages Directory,  Next: The include Directory,  Prev: The clients Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The gen-manpages Directory
--------------------------

There are two manual pages in this directory.  One is an introduction
to the Kerberos system.  The other describes the `.k5login' file which
allows users to give access with their UID to other users authenticated
by the Kerberos system.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The include Directory,  Next: The kadmin Directory,  Prev: The gen-manpages Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The include Directory
---------------------

This directory contains the include files needed to build the Kerberos
system.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The kadmin Directory,  Next: The kdc Directory,  Prev: The include Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The kadmin Directory
--------------------

In this directory is the code for the utilities `kadmin',
`kadmin.local', `kdb5_util', and `ktutil'.  `ktutil' is the Kerberos
keytab file maintenance utility from which a Kerberos administrator can
read, write, or edit entries in a Kerberos V5 keytab or Kerberos V4
srvtab.  `kadmin' and `kadmin.local' are command-line interfaces to the
Kerberos V5 KADM5 administration system.  `kadmin.local' runs on the
master KDC and does not use Kerberos to authenticate to the database,
while `kadmin' uses Kerberos authentication and an encrypted RPC.  The
two provide identical functionalities, which allow administrators to
modify the database of Kerberos principals.  `kdb5_util' allows
administrators to perform low-level maintenance procedures on Kerberos
and the KADM5 database.  With this utility, databases can be created,
destroyed, or dumped to and loaded from ASCII files.  It can also be
used to create master key stash files.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The kdc Directory,  Next: The krb524 Directory,  Prev: The kadmin Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The kdc Directory

This directory contains the code for the `krb5kdc' daemon, the Kerberos
Authentication Service and Key Distribution Center.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The krb524 Directory,  Next: The lib Directory,  Prev: The kdc Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The krb524 Directory
--------------------

This directory contains the code for `krb524', a service that converts
Kerberos V5 credentials into Kerberos V4 credentials suitable for use
with applications that for whatever reason do not use V5 directly.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The lib Directory,  Next: The prototype Directory,  Prev: The krb524 Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The lib Directory
-----------------

The lib directory contain 10 subdirectories as well as some definition
and glue files.  The crypto subdirectory contains the Kerberos V5
encryption library.  The des425 subdirectory exports the Kerberos V4
encryption API, and translates these functions into calls to the
Kerberos V5 encryption API.  The gssapi library contains the Generic
Security Services API, which is a library of commands to be used in
secure client-server communication.  The kadm5 directory contains the
libraries for the KADM5 administration utilities.  The Kerberos 5
database libraries are contained in kdb.  The directories krb4 and krb5
contain the Kerberos 4 and Kerberos 5 APIs, respectively.  The rpc
directory contains the API for the Kerberos Remote Procedure Call
protocol.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The prototype Directory,  Next: The slave Directory,  Prev: The lib Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The prototype Directory
-----------------------

This directory contains several template files.  The `prototype.h' and
`prototype.c' files contain the MIT copyright message and a placeholder
for the title and description of the file.  `prototype.h' also has a
short template for writing `ifdef' and `ifndef' preprocessor
statements.  The `getopt.c' file provides a template for writing code
that will parse the options with which a program was called.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The slave Directory,  Next: The util Directory,  Prev: The prototype Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The slave Directory
-------------------

This directory contains code which allows for the propagation of the
Kerberos principal database from the master KDC to slave KDCs over an
encrypted, secure channel.  `kprop' is the program which actually
propagates the database dump file.  `kpropd' is the Kerberos V5 slave
KDC update server which accepts connections from the `kprop' program.
`kslave_update' is a script that takes the name of a slave server, and
propagates the database to that server if the database has been
modified since the last dump or if the database has been dumped since
the last propagation.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The util Directory,  Prev: The slave Directory,  Up: Organization of the Source Directory

The util Directory
------------------

This directory contains several utility programs and libraries.  The
programs used to configure and build the code, such as `autoconf',
`lndir', `kbuild', `reconf',  and `makedepend', are in this directory.
The profile directory contains most of the functions which parse the
Kerberos configuration files (`krb5.conf' and `kdc.conf').  Also in
this directory are the Kerberos error table library and utilities (et),
the Sub-system library and utilities (ss), database utilities (db2),
pseudo-terminal utilities (pty), bug-reporting program `send-pr', and a
generic support library `support' used by several of our other
libraries.
