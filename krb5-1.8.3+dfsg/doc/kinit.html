<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>kinit</I> obtains and caches an initial  ticket-granting  ticket
     for <I>principal</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -<B>V</B>   display verbose output.

     <B>-l</B> <I>lifetime</I>
          requests a ticket  with  the  lifetime  <I>lifetime</I>.   The
          value  for <I>lifetime</I> must be followed immediately by one
          of the following delimiters:

             <B>s</B>  seconds
             <B>m</B>  minutes
             <B>h</B>  hours
             <B>d</B>  days

          as in "kinit -l 90m".  You cannot mix units; a value of
          `3h30m' will result in an error.

          If the -<B>l</B> option is not specified, the  default  ticket
          lifetime (configured by each site) is used.  Specifying
          a ticket lifetime longer than the maximum ticket  life-
          time (configured by each site) results in a ticket with
          the maximum lifetime.

     <B>-s</B> <I>start</I>_<I>time</I>
          requests  a  postdated  ticket,   valid   starting   at
          <I>start</I>_<I>time</I>.   Postdated  tickets  are  issued  with the
          <I>invalid</I> flag set, and need to be fed back  to  the  kdc
          before use.

     <B>-r</B> <I>renewable</I>_<I>life</I>
          requests renewable tickets, with a  total  lifetime  of
          <I>renewable</I>_<I>life</I>.   The duration is in the same format as
          the -<B>l</B> option, with the same delimiters.

     -<B>f</B>   request forwardable tickets.

     -<B>F</B>   do not request forwardable tickets.

     -<B>p</B>   request proxiable tickets.

     -<B>P</B>   do not request proxiable tickets.

     -<B>a</B>   request tickets with the local address[es].

     -<B>A</B>   request address-less tickets.

     -<B>C</B>   requests canonicalization of the principal name.

     -<B>E</B>   treats the principal name as an enterprise name.

     -<B>v</B>   requests that the ticket granting ticket in  the  cache
          (with  the  <I>invalid</I>  flag set) be passed to the kdc for
          validation.  If the ticket is within its requested time
          range, the cache is replaced with the validated ticket.

     -<B>R</B>   requests renewal of the ticket-granting  ticket.   Note
          that  an  expired ticket cannot be renewed, even if the
          ticket is still within its renewable life.

     <B>-k</B> [<B>-t</B> <I>keytab</I>_<I>file</I>]
          requests a host ticket, obtained  from  a  key  in  the
          local host's <I>keytab</I> file.  The name and location of the
          keytab file may be specified with  the  -<B>t</B>  <I>keytab</I>_<I>file</I>
          option; otherwise the default name and location will be
          used.

     <B>-n</B>   Requests anonymous processing.  Two types of  anonymous
          principals  are  supported.   For  fully anonymous Ker-
          beros,  configure  pkinit  on  the  KDC  and  configure
          <I>pkinit</I>_<I>anchors</I> in the client's krb5.conf.  Then use the
          <B>-n</B> option with a principal of the form @<I>REALM</I> (an empty
          principal  name  followed  by  the  at-sign and a realm
          name).  If permitted by the KDC,  an  anonymous  ticket
          will  be  returned.  A second form of anonymous tickets
          is supported;  these  realm-exposed  tickets  hide  the
          identity of the client but not the client's realm.  For
          this mode, use <B>kinit</B> <B>-n</B> with a normal  principal  name.
          If  supported by the KDC, the principal (but not realm)
          will be replaced by the  anonymous  principal.   As  of
          release  1.8,  the MIT Kerberos KDC only supports fully
          anonymous operation.

     <B>-T</B> <I>armor</I>_<I>ccache</I>
          Specifies the name of a credential cache  that  already
          contains  a  ticket.   If  supported  by  the KDC, This
          ccache will be used to armor the  request  so  that  an
          attacker  would  have to know both the key of the armor
          ticket and the key of the principal used for  authenti-
          cation  in  order  to attack the request. Armoring also
          makes sure that  the  response  from  the  KDC  is  not
          modified in transit.

     <B>-c</B> <I>cache</I>_<I>name</I>
          use <I>cache</I>_<I>name</I> as the Kerberos 5  credentials  (ticket)
          cache  name  and  location; if this option is not used,
          the default cache name and location are used.

          The default credentials cache may vary between systems.
          If  the  <B>KRB5CCNAME</B>  environment  variable  is set, its
          value is used to name the default  ticket  cache.   Any
          existing contents of the cache are destroyed by <I>kinit</I>.

     <B>-S</B> <I>service</I>_<I>name</I>
          specify an alternate service name to use  when  getting
          initial tickets.

     <B>-X</B> <I>attribute</I>[=<I>value</I>]
          specify a pre-authentication attribute and value to  be
          passed  to  pre-authentication plugins.  The acceptable
          <I>attribute</I> and <I>value</I> values vary from pre-authentication
          plugin  to plugin.  This option may be specified multi-
          ple times to specify multiple attributes.  If no  <I>value</I>
          is specified, it is assumed to be "yes".

          The following attributes are recognized by the OpenSSL pkinit
          pre-authentication mechanism:
             <B>X509_user_identity</B>=<I>value</I>
                specify where to find user's X509 identity information
             <B>X509_anchors</B>=<I>value</I>
                specify where to find trusted X509 anchor information
             <B>flag_RSA_PROTOCOL</B>[=yes]
                specify use of RSA, rather than the default Diffie-Hellman protocol



</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <B>Kinit</B> uses the following environment variables:

                     (ticket) cache.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     /tmp/krb5cc_[uid]  default location of  Kerberos  5  creden-
                        tials  cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of
                        the user).

     /etc/krb5.keytab   default location  for  the  local  host's
                        <B>keytab</B> file.
