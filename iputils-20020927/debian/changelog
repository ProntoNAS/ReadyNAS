iputils (3:20020927-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build system cleanup.  Stop including anything from /usr/src/linux.
    We still define our own versions of things that should be included
    from /usr/src/sys, and this needs to be fixed, but I will wait until
    post sarge to do so.  (Closes: Bug#223164)
  * Install symlink for tracepath6 man page.

iputils (3:20020927-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  (Closes: Bug#151980)
  * Changed iputils-ping to Priority: important
  * Changed iputils-tracepath to Priority: optional
  * Added RELNOTES to /usr/share/doc/iputils-* as the upstream changelog.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.5.7.0
  * Changed the sparc kludge (see prev. version's changes) to avoid
    using the SO_TIMESTAMP sockopt, since that seems to be where the 
    problem is.  -U is no longer forced.
  * Fixed '==' typo on line 444 of traceroute6.c.  The patch has been
    sent upstream and will be in future releases.

iputils (3:20020124-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added kludge to force -U on ping and ping6 on SPARC, since neither
    program will report correct times at all otherwise.  This will be fixed
    correctly at some point in the future, but possibly not before
    woody's release.  (Closes: Bug#122379)
  * Fixed a printf error in tracepath6.c that caused some slightly
    ugly (non zero-padded) output. (Closes: Bug#141300)
  * Fixed a typo in tracepath.8 (Closes: Bug#135274)
  * Removed reference to clockdiff(8) from arping.8 since clockdiff
    is not packaged.

iputils (20001110-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: Bug#80250, Bug#80251)
  * Removed most of the Debian patches: too much has changed upstream to
    reasonably forward port them. Maxwait argument thus
    disappeared. (Closes: Bug#65597)
  * Shouldn't have any security problems, theoretically. (Closes: Bug#69472)
  * Descriptions have been updated a while ago. (Closes: Bug#68973)

  * Orphaned, maintainer set to debian-qa.
