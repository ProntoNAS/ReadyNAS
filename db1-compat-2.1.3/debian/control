Description: The Berkeley database routines [glibc 2.0/2.1 compatibility]
 libdb is a library for manipulating database files, developed at Berkeley.
 .
 It supports three kinds of file formats:
  * btree. A representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed or variable length
    records.
 .
 This library exists for compatibility with applications built against
 glibc 2.0 or 2.1. There is intentionally no corresponding development
 package. Do not link new applications against this library!
