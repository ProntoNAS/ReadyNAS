This package was put together by Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org> on
Sun, 11 Aug 2002 12:51:37 +0100. The original source tarball was repacked
in .tar.gz format from the file 'db1-addon-2.1.3.tar.bz2' found in the
Debian source package for glibc 2.2.5-12.

   * The code for the database library `libdb' comes from the 2.3
     release of Berkeley DB. That code is under the same copyright as

            3. Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by
               information on how to obtain complete source code for
               the DB software and any accompanying software that uses
               the DB software.  The source code must either be
               included in the distribution or be available for no more
               than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and
               must be freely redistributable under reasonable
               conditions.  For an executable file, complete source
               code means the source code for all modules it contains.
               It does not mean source code for modules or files that
               typically accompany the operating system on which the
               executable file runs, e.g., standard library modules or
               system header files.
