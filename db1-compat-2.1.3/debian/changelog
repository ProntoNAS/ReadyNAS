db1-compat (2.1.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * glibc's db1 used the soname "libdb.so.2.1" on alpha (thanks, Ben
    Mansell). Change our alpha soname to be in sync with this. (I haven't
    changed the package name, as nothing can legitimately build against
    db1-compat and the old soname was just a bug.)

db1-compat (2.1.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * -D_LIBC apparently doesn't work with glibc 2.3 (thanks, Jack Howarth).
    Remove it and comment out the #ifdefs from the code instead, so that we
    always get the extra symbols (closes: #163264).

db1-compat (2.1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Translate __PMT() to __P() on non-glibc architectures that don't have
    the former. This is just a temporary fix, as those architectures
    shouldn't need to keep db1-compat around for the long term.

db1-compat (2.1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Instead of having to hard-code architecture details in order to use
    substvars, just use one big Replaces: line.

db1-compat (2.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -D_LIBC so that we get __dbopen (Ben Collins).
  * Import part of libc-symbols.h from glibc, for weak alias definitions.

db1-compat (2.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call the binary package libdb1-compat, not libdb1g.

db1-compat (2.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release, constructed from db1-addon-2.1.3.tar.bz2 in glibc's
    source package.
  * Alter Makefile to build outside glibc. Preprocess Versions in the way
    glibc's versioning helper scripts would, so we don't have to carry them
    around.
