	  <option>
		<p><opt>INTERFACES</opt></p> <optdesc><p>Specifies the
		ethernet interfaces to monitor. It has to contain a space
		seperated list of network interfaces names. Most users will
		probably use "eth0" here, however you may add additional
		interfaces for monitoring more than one device. A special
		value is supported as well: "auto" will enable a more or less
		working auto detection of available network devices. This
		won't make you happy when using network module auto loading,
		since it cannot detect currently unloaded network
		devices.</p></optdesc>
	  </option>

	  <option>
		<p><opt>ARGS</opt></p> <optdesc><p>Additional command line
		arguments for ifplugd invocation. See <manref name="ifplugd"
		section="8"/> for further information.</p></optdesc>
