libgphoto2 (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Poke upstream to get copyright and license statements clarified.
  * Adjust the Depends: according to the content of the “*.pc” files.
  * Write manpages for the following Perl scripts, and submit them
    upstream for inclusion:
     - /usr/bin/gphoto2-config (source: gphoto2-config.in)
     - /usr/bin/gphoto2-port-config (source: libgphoto2_port/gphoto2-port-config.in)
  * Are those scripts really needed anyway? A call to pkg-config would
    do the job.
