nut (2.7.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since version 1.2 NUT-Monitor uses safer directory permissions when
  creating ~/.nut-monitor.

  NUT-Monitor will now detect a pre-1.2 settings directory on startup
  and update its permissions.

  Please note that passwords stored in NUT-Monitor prior to this change
  may have been exposed, and it is recommended that they be reset.
