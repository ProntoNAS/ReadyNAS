A tiny example wordlist is included with the cracklib package
itself. A very large dictionary suitable for use with cracklib
is also available from the cracklib sourceforge download page.

Other sources for word lists include:

	http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/

	http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/

Please note, the licenses on some of those word lists are
restrictive, so please read the licenses before redistributing them.
The cracklib-words distribution from the cracklib sourceforge
project page has been built solely from word lists previously
distributed with cracklib or crack packages and/or public
domain word lists.

For best results, supply cracklib with as large a wordlist as you 
have available to you - blackhats brute forcing passwords have those
same lists, might as well use it to benefit your security.
