cracklib2 (2.8.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: update to Standards-Version to 3.9.1
    - use Breaks instead of Conflicts for libcrack2's incompatibility with
      cracklib2 (<< 2.8.12-1) and libcrack2-dev's incompatibility with
      cracklib2-dev (<< 2.8.12-1)
  * add debian/patches/596281-fix-python-extension-segfault.patch: in
    cracklib-python's C module, make sure we initialize defaultdict to
    NULL at the start of _cracklib_FascistCheck. This fixes a bug where
    that variable was freed when not NULL without ever having been
    assigned any value to.  This happened when we called FascistCheck()
    with a dictionary path of our own. Thanks to Peter Palfrader for the
    patch (Closes: #596281).

cracklib2 (2.7-8.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload. Urgency medium as this is keeping other packages
    out of testing.
  * debian/dpkg.common/rules: Move calls to dpkg-shlibdeps and
    dpkg-gencontrol from the build target to binary, as dpkg-shlibdeps
    doesn't like being called as non-root (closes: #97855).
  * Call ldconfig without arguments, for the Hurd (closes: #108822).
  * Fix typo in crack_teststr(8)'s NAME section (closes: #99512).
  * Exit 0 and don't complain in the syslog if cracklib-runtime is removed
    but not purged (closes: #95291).
  * logger is no longer used as a result of the above (closes: #62393).

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/dpkg.common/modifysrc: Support build environments where the
    .orig.tar.gz is not present in the parent directory (thanks, Mikko
    Markus Torni; closes: #87355).
  * debhelper namespacing was fixed in previous NMU, but fixed it more
    neatly while I'm here (closes: #75376).
  * Move to FHS locations for documentation (thanks, Jonathon M. Abbott;
    closes: #91135, #91136, #91407, #91414, #91429).
  * Don't link with -nodefaultlibs, as it has bad effects on some platforms
    (closes: #72244).

  * Bump Standards-Version: to 3.1.1 and add build-dependency on debhelper

    output of dpkg-parsechangelog for "Version: " instead of "^Version: ",
    which broke with the above changelog entry.
