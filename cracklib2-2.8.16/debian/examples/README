Example for cracklib2
---------------------

This example demonstrates the usage of cracklib2. Just enter a
potential password and the program will answer whether it is good, and
if not, why.

Usage: copy Makefile and cracklib_example.c into a writable directory,
run 'make' and start 'cracklib_example'.

You must have the package cracklib-runtime installed to actually make
it work, since otherwise cracklib has no wordlists to check against.

cracklib-runtime also provides a test program crack_testlib(8) which
has a similar function.
