ChangeLog for ifupdown
======================

2000-11-18   0.6.4  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Shouldn't use errno, apparently. Should use ferror() instead.
	  What a completely stupid API. Thanks to Roderich Schupp for
	  pointing this out.

	* Use $(( .. )) in a shell for math, not $[..] which is bash only.
	  Thanks to Kalle Olavi Niemitalo for this one.

2000-10-20   0.6.3  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Fixed horrible bugs where to get n structures I realloc n
	  bytes, instead of n * sizeof(..) bytes. Shame on me.

	* Don't commit the new networking state to the statefile when
	  --no-act is happening (after all, there *aren't* any changes...)

	* Bring forward some changes from the .deb:
		- /var/run/ifupdown.state -> /etc/network/ifstate
		  (/var may be NFS mounted...)
		- Add /e/n/ifstate to manpage.
		- Add pointopoint support for inet/static.
		- dhcpcd works with all kernels, not "2.0 and 2.2" :)
		- Add provider support for ppp. It's still a kludge.
		- Update ipx address family.
		- Remove noauto from the interfaces manpage.

2000-09-22   0.6.2  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Aieee. cardmgr (pcmcia utility) starts with stdin *closed*,
	  rather than redirected from /dev/null. So when I open pipes
	  and stuff, it can come up as fd 0. Not good. Fake fd 0,1,2 as
	  /dev/null if they're not already existant.

	* Fixed silly bug about not properly downing interfaces too.

2000-09-15   0.6.1  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Fixed up defn2man.pl so that /usr/share/doc (eg) isn't italicised.

	* Cleaned up execute.c and updated literate comments to match new
	  behaviour.
	* Update literate comments for main.c too.

	* Fixed --no-act and --verbose to actually work, rather than just
	  be faked. Both are now program-wide variables declared in
	  main.c.

	* Included some explanatory diagrams (.dia's), and some build code
	  to actually include them in the woven output. They're done as .eps
	  files which pdflatex can't handle. Bummer.

	* Largely updated manpage to reflect changes in 0.6

	* Changed behaviour of --no-act to still run any mappings. (Use
	  --no-mappings as well to disable those)
	* Add a --version option.
	* Only update the state file if the interface was found.

2000-06-09   0.6.0  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* STILL TO DO: update manpage, tidy up the changed literate source.

	* run-parts /etc/network/if-{up,down,pre-up,post-down}.d is called
	  after running any iface-specific scripts.
	* Environment of called programs contains exactly:
		IF_<option>=<value>
		IFACE=<physical iface name>
		MODE=<start or stop>
	  and whatever /bin/sh defaults to initialising.

	* Each option may only be specified once.
	* Added `auto lo eth0', remove `noauto'.
	* Added mapping support. Thanks to Marc Haber for the inspiration.
	* Removed scheme support.
	* Report line-number as well as file name, when read_interfaces()
	  fails.

	* Added /var/run/ifupdown.state
	* Made ifdown -a use the statefile rather than the config file.

	* Added inet6 methods static and v4tunnel. (Thanks to Bastian
	  Blank for a patch for the former)
	* Made "pre-up", "down", "post-down" manpage descriptions
	  match the "up" description. Yay for redundancy.

2000-03-23   0.5.5  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Added "pre-up" and "post-down" options.

2000-02-29   0.5.4  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Some more minor cleanups.

2000-02-29   0.5.3  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Minor cleanups; added ifup.8.ps.gz and interfaces.5.ps.gz
	  to the default target.

2000-02-28   0.5.2  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Change the dhcpcd/dhcpcd-sv stuff to refer to just
	  /sbin/dhcpcd, instead of checking for dhcpcd-sv
	  specifically.

	* Add a manpage for /etc/network/interfaces, thanks
	  to Joey Hess. Rearranged ifup(8) a bit, and
	  added some stuff to it. Also actually wrote the
	  *bold* and /italic/ handling.

	* Finally got sick of lines longer than 80 chars in
	  .defn files and added \ escaping of newlines.

2000-02-13   0.5.1  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Cleaned up some of the source.

	* Redefined .defn files a bit: added a description tag for
	  methods, and made the options list be documentation
	  for the options rather than something useful for C.

	* Added defn2man.pl, and made a manpage (generated from
	  ifupdown.8.pre and defn2man.pl).

2000-02-07   0.5.0  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Initial release, from netbase.deb, 3.16-9
