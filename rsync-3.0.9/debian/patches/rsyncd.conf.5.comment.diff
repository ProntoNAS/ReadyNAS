 .PP 
 Any line beginning with a hash (#) is ignored, as are lines containing
 only whitespace.
+Note that a hash in the middle of a line is used as-is,
+hence it is not possible to put a comment at the end of a parameter;
+the hash and following text becomes part of the parameter.
 .PP 
 Any line ending in a \e is \(lqcontinued\(rq on the next line in the
 customary UNIX fashion.
