unzip (6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #496989.
  * Enabled new Unicode support. Closes: #197427. This may or may not work
    for your already created zipfiles, but it's not a bug unless they were
    created using the Unicode feature present in zip 3.0.
  * Built using DATE_FORMAT=DF_YMD so that unzip -l show dates in ISO format,
    as that's the only available one which makes sense. Closes: #312886.
  * Enabled new bzip2 support. Closes: #426798.
  * Exit code for zipgrep should now be the right one. Closes: #441997.
  * The reason why a file may not be created is now shown. Closes: #478791.
  * Summary of changes in this version not being the debian/* files:
  - Manpages in section 1, not 1L.
  - Branding patch. UnZip by Debian. Original by Info-ZIP.
  - Always #include <unistd.h>. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD needs it.
