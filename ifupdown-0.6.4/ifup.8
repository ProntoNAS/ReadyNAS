.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ifup " and " ifdown
commands may be used to configure (or, respectively, deconfigure) network
interfaces, based on descriptions of the interfaces entered into the file
.IR /etc/network/interfaces .

options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.

.SH NOTES
The
.BR ifup " and " ifdown
programs don't actually know anything about configuring interfaces themselves
but instead invoke lower-level utilities such as
.BR ifconfig " and " route
to do the actual dirtywork. The main advantages to using
.BR ifup " and " ifdown
instead of calling the lower-level utilities directy is the ability to
keep all your interface specifications in a single (easily parsable) file,
and to not have to deal with the various idiosyncracies of the lower-level
commands.
.SH FILES
