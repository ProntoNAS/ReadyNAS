ifupdown (0.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't delete /etc/network/ifstate every boot, just empty the file. This
    way people can symlink it to /var/run/ifstate if they so desire (ie, if
    /var is local and /etc is read-only). (Closes: Bug#103868, Bug#85206)
  * Explicitly set PATH in the environment, because pdksh is broken, broken
    I say. (Closes: Bug#83557, Bug#99444)

ifupdown (0.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add some test cases to hopefully catch miscompiles on silly
    architectures like alpha. Weirdly, I can't duplicate this bug on
    lully anymore, so I didn't add a -O0 workaround at this time. We'll
    see what happens. (Closes: Bug#81143)

  * Correct old /e/n/i check from -2 so it might even work. (Closes:
    Bug#81611)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue,  9 Jan 2001 10:48:18 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for old /etc/network/interfaces conffile (all comments, same
    md5, same size), and replace it with new conffile so as not to mislead
    people into forgetting the "auto" lines. (Closes: Bug#79822) 

  * Added wvdial support, theoretically. If it doesn't work, someone'll have
    to file a new bug and tell me. (Closes: Bug#76985)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Dec 2000 21:28:47 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Removes a bashism from the makefile, and uses
    ferror() correctly (hopefully) (Closes: Bug#75279, Bug#76086)

  * Add example that checks a MAC address is what it should be. (Closes:
    Bug#76198)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 15:33:22 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Debian patches incorporated upstream, and a
    big fix wrt memory allocation.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Oct 2000 18:38:10 -0700

ifupdown (0.6.2pr-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename to ifupdown. Let's see what breaks.

  * Add pointopoint option for static inet interfaces. (Closes: Bug#74563)

  * Updating to 0.6.x fixes some problems:
        --scheme no longer exists (Closes: Bug#54814)
        line numbers are reported (Closes: Bug#62542)
        you can use $IFACE in /e/n/interfaces (Closes: Bug#71779)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Oct 2000 19:30:54 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup /etc/network/ifstate when booting (it will be wrong
    if the system crashed).

  * This should be enough for ifupdown.deb to be updated, hopefully.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2000 19:41:34 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The previous few uploads should've fixed most of the bugs
    described in 72872. (Closes: Bug#72872)

  * Add .sh suffixes to the example mapping scripts.
  * Fix a typo in postinst (interface *file* not files)
  * Add a "press enter to continue" if the /e/n/i update fails. 

  * Moved /var/run/ifupdown.state to /etc/network/ifstate. Gross.
    (Closes: Bug#74312)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 23:52:02 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-4) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 21:53:21 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started work on automatically converting from 0.5.x config format to
    0.6.x.
  * Move the example from /usr/share/doc/ifupdown to ifupdown0.6.
  * Add some example mapping scripts. 

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 18:15:10 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note that dhcpcd works with any kernel, not just 2.0 and 2.2.
  * Remove the "noauto" keyword from the manpage. Ooopsy.
  * Create /etc/network/if-*.d directories in preinst.
  * Update the example-etc-network-interfaces to use the auto keyword.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Sep 2000 17:05:21 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Forward port some fixes from the last .deb that I hadn't put in the
    upstream source. Whoops.

  * This is a beta package that doesn't upgrade cleanly from ifupdown. It's
    for testing purposes only.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Sep 2000 16:05:25 -0700

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Adjusted to *always* build from scratch if noweb is
    installed, to ensure that the various .c and .defn files are updated
    wherever possible. This should fix the problem where the updated
    inet6.defn wasn't being included, even after -2, amongst others.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2000 12:40:28 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: chmod +x any scripts that are created when the diff is
    applied. (Closes: Bug#70030)

  * ifupdown.nw: Forward port lost changes from netbase 3.18-4.
    (Closes: Bug#69723)
  * ifupdown.nw: Specify interface explicitly when adding default routes,
    and explicitly remove the route when deconfiguring an interface.
    (Closes: Bug#63071, Bug#67796)

  * debian/control: Add dependency on net-tools.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Aug 2000 17:47:01 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thought through and removed build-dependency on noweb. This involves
    changing what I put in the .orig.tar.gz. (Closes: Bug#68869)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Aug 2000 18:09:09 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low
