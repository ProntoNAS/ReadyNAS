  * Due to changes of names in directories, which are not catched by
    dpkg-source, the package build misbehaved. Added changing of dir
    names on the fly before and after the generation of diff.gz
    Horrible hack! but closes: #63112, 
  * Due to the change of arch (from i396 to all) for libdb2.6 packages
    (now they are empty and are there only to replace the previous), I
    noticed that the upload to frozen broke them up, stopping the
    installation of the "new" ones, and leaving there the previous ones,
    which is obviously wrong. This package generates a full set of libdb
    packages and a full set of empty packages aiming to correct
    dependences and replaces in the the older ones. Please install all
    together in potato.
    (side note: as new versions are not going installed, people are
    submitting important bugs on the last one for bugs that are
    supposedly fixed. I know that this circular situation should be
    broken somether, but not in half/half).

  * added versioned depend in shlib (this was important indeed).
  * the day after post-release. include minor things forgot in the
    previous; you would need a computer to remember everything!
  * Spent the full eastern to debug the intricacies of depends/conflicts
    and replace. It happens that I usually check only the correctness of
    these in the current set of pkgs, but in this case we had a previous
    set of pkgs with reversed depends/conflics.
    But thanks to Jason, his recent message to debian-devel and the
    option  -o debug::pkgproblemresolver=true  I got it wright!
  * What a mess of numbers! Let's use a letter as debian-version.
  * built issuing "make {debian,apt,upload}" <grin>. Should be
    architecture indipendent.
  * Just discovered that the source do not bootstrap (build if a
    previous version is not installed). Solved using
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.   in  dpkg-shlibdeps  line (libdb2++).
  * libc6 installs libdb.so.3 in /lib, and points to us in its shlib, 
    so a lot of people already depends on libdb2 while linking using
    libc6 soname! But those binaries complain when loading this version
    of libdb. (espy, i would like to torture you until you start
    doindoing finnish ... say "saunaa, löylyä, olutta, krapula").
    :-)      just kidding, i'm a long-bearded heavy-belted pacifist.
  * this source also builds empty libdb2.6 packages, each with the
    dependency on the corresponding libdb2 package plus, for the two
    runtime packages, a symlink to the previous libname, to fullfill
    eventual external dependencies.
    This means that the old source db2.6 should be removed from potato.
    apt dist-upgrade works smoothly, as libdb2 replaces libdb2.6.
    Also lib-bdb2 should be removed from woody.
  * Reverted to the old and right name for binaries, corrected manpages
    and html docs. Added conflict with no-more-existing libc6-bin.
  * Installs header files in db2 subdir, and a symlink from alternative
    names. This will in any case need people to change compile line to
    add "-I/usr/include/db2" and link using "-ldb2".
  * Created new manpage for db_printlog, from a dump of a html page
    present in the new libdb3. Lintian is very happy now.
  * previous version installed images still uuencoded.

    E: libdb2++-dbg: no-shlibs-control-file
       although I could see several reasons for asking lintian not to 
       report such as error, I can see one remote possibility that
       someone could build a debian package which depends on a debugging 
       or profiling shared lib, so I'll keep this as a good Error
       and I'll add a shlibs file. Thanks lintian for making me think!
  * Changed doc symlink to point to the ++ package, because lintian:
    E: libdb2++-dbg: usr-doc-symlink-without-dependency libdb2
    E: libdb2++-dev: usr-doc-symlink-without-dependency libdb2
       This is really a limit in lintian: in fact these packges
       installs a symlink to /usr/doc/libdb2 where are the copyright 
       and the changelog files, but the "++" ones depend on libdb2 only 
       through libdb2++, which depends on libdb2.

    in distclean and build targets, due to upstream's strange idea 
    of writability of sources. (closes: #19074)

    future libdb2-doc separate package with postscript doc files)
  * built again also static libs (in -dev): untill all switches to my
    proposed -dbg shared system, it would be impossible to link libc_g

db (2.3.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * oops, moved db_dump185 form libdb2-dev to libdb2 and db_printlog
    from libdb2-dev to libdb2-dbg, but I forgot to add the Replaces:
    field against libdb2-dev. Tx to Manoj; fixes:#17641

db (2.3.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * purged java support (Guy, please remove the old libdb2-java package
    from the ftp site): didn't work on all architectures, I wasn't sure
    it worked even on i386, and ... I want to let the sources in the
    main distrib (jdk is non-free).
  * corrected depends of ++ {-dev,-dbg} packages to libg++-dev.
  * moved optional programs in runtime package or in -dbg.
  * added clean of the links .cpp->.cc (were left in the diff :-( )
  * purged creation of static libs both in -dev package and in -dbg
    package. Is there a *real* need to statically link?
  * avoided all 'hell' from compilation, fixes:#16038 (this was fixed in
    previous version, but left one month for comments :-)
  * updated manpages to reflect location of include files.
  * changed description in debian/control (fixes:#16409)
  * upstream distribution has strange permissions in the tarball: owners
    can't write and some files should be executable (dist/config.* ...)
  * new upstream release.
  * got rid of -O2 in compiling -dbg packages: only -g3.

db (2.3.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved java binary to contrib section, due to use of jdk.
    (thanx to James Troup for noticing)
  * added debug instructions in file README.debug, which needs anyway to
    be rewritten in better english :-)
  * changed dbg package to install shared debug lib in 
    /usr/lib/debug and profile lib in /usr/lib/profile.
  * splitted debian/rules in included debian/policy, which is included
    both from debian/rules and Makefile. It provides macros as make
    variables which implements debian's policy in some way, and
    overwrites implicit rules for debugging purposes only.
  * created new simplyfied debian/Makefile which uses implicit rules.
    Now calls configure only once or twice to build the headers and the
    Makefile used to get the list of needed objects, included by the new
    debian/Makefile.
  * avoided symlink to /usr/src changing .stab in asm source 
    file (overwritten implicit rule to produce asm source).
    Thanx to Martin Schulze <joey> for the help. closes:#16038
  * created shared debugging libs
