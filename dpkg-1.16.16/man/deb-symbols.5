.SH NAME
deb\-symbols \- Debian's extended shared library information file
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
symbols
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The format for an extended shared library dependency information entry
in these files is:
.PP
.I library-soname main-dependency-template
.br
[| \fIalternative-dependency-template\fP]
.br
[...]
.br
[* \fIfield-name\fP: \fIfield-value\fP]
.br
[...]
 \fIsymbol\fP \fIminimal-version\fP [\fIid-of-dependency-template\fP]
.P
The \fIlibrary-soname\fR is exactly the value of the SONAME field
as exported by \fBobjdump\fR(1). A \fIdependency-template\fR is a
dependency where \fI#MINVER#\fR is dynamically replaced either by
a version check like "(>= \fIminimal-version\fR)" or by nothing (if
an unversioned dependency is deemed sufficient). 
.P
Each exported \fIsymbol\fR (listed as \fIname\fR@\fIversion\fR, with
\fIversion\fR being "Base" if the library is not versioned) is associated
to a \fIminimal-version\fR of its dependency template (the main dependency
template is used if \fIid-of-dependency-template\fR is not present). The
first alternative dependency template is numbered 1, the second one 2,
etc.
.P
Each entry for a library can also have some fields of meta-information.
Those fields are stored on lines starting with an asterisk. Currently,
the only valid field is \fIBuild\-Depends\-Package\fR, it indicates the name
of the "\-dev" package associated to the library and is used by
\fBdpkg\-shlibdeps\fP to make sure that the dependency generated is at least as
strict as the corresponding build dependency.
