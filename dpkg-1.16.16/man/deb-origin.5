.SH NAME
deb\-origin \- Vendor-specific information files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI /etc/dpkg/origins/ filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
The files in \fB/etc/dpkg/origins\fP can provide information about
various vendors who are providing Debian packages. They contain a
number of fields, or comments when the line starts with \fB'#'\fP.
Each field begins with a tag, such as \fBVendor\fP or \fBParent\fP,
followed by a colon and the body of the field. Fields are delimited
only by field tags. In other words, field text may be multiple lines
in length, but the tools will join lines when processing the body of
the field.
