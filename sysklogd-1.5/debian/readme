Additional information about system logging
-------------------------------------------

 . When logging into a fifo syslogd will stop loggin into this
   logfile if no process is reading it and thus the buffer is filled
   up.  Buffer size can be adjusted through the kernel.

 . When using the Perl5 Sys::Syslog module (use Sys::Syslog;) to
   provide logging to your Perl programs, please notice that since it
   will open a UDP connection to the local syslogd you'll need to have
   remote receiption enabled.

   Joey Hess teaches us how to change this behaviour and switch to
   using the Unix domain socket.  After the opening with "use" you
   have to add "Sys::Syslog::setlogsock('unix');".

   The default behaviour might change in future releases of Perl.

Modifying the kernel console log level
--------------------------------------

  There are two ways to alter the kernel console log level.  This
  setting controls whether log messages from the kernel should appear
  on the system console or not.

  In the past, klogd had to do this with the -c parameter.  Using '-c
  4' will set the log level of console messages to 4 and only display
  warnings and errors but not regular debug or information messages.

  This behaviour is deprecated and hencely not enforced anymore via
  the RC script of klogd.  Instead sysctl(8) should be used as
  interface to various kernel variables.  These can be stored
  non-volatile in /etc/sysctl.conf.

  The prevent the kernel to flood the system console and to achieve
  the same behaviour of '-c 4' simply add the following to the
  configuration file and let sysctl set this kernel parameter upon
  system boot.

  kernel/printk = 4 4 1 7

  More information can be found in Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt in
  the kernel source and proc(5).
