Description: Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration.  For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the Avahi Daemon which represents your machine
 on the network and allows other applications to publish and resolve
 mDNS/DNS-SD records.

Description: Avahi common library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration.  For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the Avahi common library, which is a set of common
 functions used by many of Avahis components and client applications.

Description: Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration.  For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the library for Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD stack.
 This can be used by embedded applications to integrate mDNS/DNS-SD
 functionality into their applications.
 .
 You should not however use this library for non-embedded applications, you
 shoudl use libavahi-client which interacts with the avahi daemon.
