 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat, 19 May 2007 02:09:12 +0200

libapreq2 (2.08-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix typo; libapreq2 recommended libapreq2-mod-apreq2, which is obviously
    wrong. Change to libapache2-mod-apreq2.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Oct 2006 02:40:32 +0100

libapreq2 (2.08-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * urgency=high to get the package into testing in time for the
    Apache 2.2 transition.
  * Update dependency from libapreq2-dev on libapr0-dev to libapr1-dev; fixes
    uninstallability. (Closes: #394614)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Oct 2006 12:02:09 +0200

libapreq2 (2.08-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against Apache 2.2.
    * Build-depend on libapache2-mod-perl2 (>= 2.0.2-2.1), to make sure we
      get an Apache 2.2-capable mod_perl.
    * Depend on apache2.2-common instead of apache2-common.
    * Build-depend on libapr1-dev instead of libapr0-dev.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Oct 2006 02:12:06 +0200

libapreq2 (2.08-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Sep 2006 22:45:24 +0200

libapreq2 (2.07-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    * [CVE-2006-0042] Fixes a possible remote DoS due to quadratic behaviour
      in apreq_parse_{headers,urlencoded}.
  * Removed INSTALLDIRS=vendor from Makefile.PL, it seems to choke on it
    now (and we've still got it in make install).
  * Include debhelper token in libapache2-mod-apreq2.postrm.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Feb 2006 12:41:27 +0100

libapreq2 (2.06-dev-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hardcode $prefix in apreq2-config.in to /usr, so apreq2-config gives out
    more sensible values. (Closes: #323108)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Oct 2005 18:53:46 +0200

libapreq2 (2.06-dev-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Remove the spurious “2” file in the diff.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Aug 2005 13:22:11 +0200

libapreq2 (2.05-dev-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a dependency from libapache2-request-perl to libapache2-mod-apreq2.
    (Closes: #319614)
  * Fix the short description of libapache2-mod-apreq2 to say that it's
    actually an Apache module.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Aug 2005 02:10:38 +0200

libapreq2 (2.05-dev-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libapreq2-dev depend on libapr0-dev. (Closes: #317301)
  * Disable module on uninstall, if it is enabled. (Closes: #301685)
  * Split out libapache2-mod-apreq2 into a separate package.
    (Closes: #315971)
  * Add a Replaces: on libapache2-mod-apreq2 to all the packages that
    were split out in 2.05-dev-3, to be able to do upgrades correctly.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes needed).
  * Drop the shlibs file, and generate it using dh_makeshlibs and
    dh_shlibdeps instead.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jul 2005 23:31:22 +0200

libapreq2 (2.05-dev-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change ${Version} (which is a syntax error) in debian/control to
    ${Source-Version}, which makes the Depends: lines be generated again.
    (Closes: #314859)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jun 2005 13:03:22 +0200

libapreq2 (2.05-dev-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed source package name, since we aren't a Perl-only package.
  * Split the binary package into separate parts, separating the Perl glue
    from the rest and the binary into its own part. Note that this is
    somewhat experimental yet. :-) (Closes: #311622)
  * Bumped the versioned dependency on the libapache2-mod-perl2 (see
    last upload).
  * Removed redundant dh_* commands from debian/rules.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Jun 2005 14:49:32 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.05-dev-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump versioned Build-Dependency on libapache2-mod-perl2, as we had
    an ABI change in 2.05-dev. (Closes: #311623)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Jun 2005 02:02:31 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.05-dev-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, works properly with newer mod_perl2.
    (Closes: #309894)
    * Removed old "realclean" hack from build system.
    * Updated module name in .load file from mod_apreq.so to mod_apreq2.so.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Fri, 20 May 2005 15:07:09 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.04-dev-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. (Closes: #293099)
  * Build-Depend on libapache2-request-perl2-dev, as the new upstream version
    now needs some header files from it.
  * Don't give lots of unneeded README files to dh_installdocs, they aren't
    installed anyhow.
  * Include HTML documentation in package. (Closes: #286810)
  * Fix capitalization in package description.
  * Updated debian/copyright:
    * Update license from LICENSE file (upstream has moved to Apache 2.0
      license)
    * Add reference to myself.
    * Add upstream URL.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Apr 2005 16:06:44 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.03-dev-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Built against non-LFS libapr0 again, as per the request of the Apache
    maintainers. Consequently removed the LFS defines from CFLAGS as well.
  * Removed dep on apache2-dev -- a versioned dependency on it is useless
    anyhow.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 23:17:13 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.03-dev-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix even more LFS problems, which were a lot more visible ("segfault
    immediately") on big-endian architectures than on little-endian
    architectures; patch from Adam Conrad.
  * Remove a few temporary files from the source distribution (reducing the
    diff by ~10kB).

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Aug 2004 03:40:24 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.03-dev-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Now has versioned Depends for libapache2-mod-perl2, not just Build-Depends
    like 2.02-dev-6 has.
  * Build with "-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64". Should hopefully
    finally fix the LFS problems.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Aug 2004 02:52:35 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New Depends for libapache2-mod-perl2 as well. (Really Closes: #266190)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Aug 2004 23:34:40 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build against new libapr0 ABI (new Depends:). (Closes: #266190)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Aug 2004 02:05:04 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed unneeded build dependency on apache2; the configure script
    now automatically assumes a correct Apache version will be installed
    on the target system. The dependency on apache2-common is now versioned
    to provide the same check at install-time. (Closes: #245490)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 18:13:02 +0200

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Don't include Apache::Cookie and Apache::Request manpages, so the package
    can be installed at the same time as libapache-request-perl.
    (Closes: #237211)
  * Add debian/compat file, so we use debhelper v4 compatibility instead of
    debhelper v1 compatibility. Updates debian/rules accordingly, and removed
    debian/conffiles, as it's no longer needed.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Mar 2004 16:46:12 +0100

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanups in debian/rules.
  * Added binary-arch and binary-indep targets, as per policy.
  * Actually _install_ libapreq2.so.2 to /usr/lib. (Closes: #234985)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Feb 2004 02:07:27 +0100

libapreq2-perl (2.02-dev-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging for Debian.

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 2004 00:14:44 +0100
